0,"&gt; # First passengers exit quarantined Japan ship

&gt; YOKOHAMA: Japan on Friday (Feb 14) began allowing elderly passengers who test negative for the new coronavirus to leave a quarantined cruise ship and finish their isolation in government-designated lodging.

&gt; 

&gt; Japan's government has given passengers aged 80 or older in poor health or confined to windowless inner cabins on the Diamond Princess the chance to move from the ship to accommodation on land.

&gt; But only those who test negative for the disease that has so far infected more than 200 people on board the ship have the option to move.

&gt; The first of them departed the massive cruise ship on Friday afternoon, travelling in buses with blacked out windows.

&gt; At the wheel, one driver was dressed in a head-to-toe white protective suit, complete with goggles and mask.

&gt; A government official said 11 people had left, but declined to say whether more would depart Friday or offer further details.

&gt; The move comes a day after the number of infections diagnosed on the ship rose to 218.

&gt; Senior health ministry official Gaku Hashimoto boarded the ship Friday morning to announce that all passengers ""who are considered to be high risk in general health"" would now be tested for the virus.

&gt; ""Those who test positive will be transferred to the hospital. Those who test negative will - at the request of the individual - disembark and be transferred to accommodation provided by the government,"" he said in a statement in English read out by the ship's captain in a public broadcast.

&gt; ""We are aware that many people are worried and concerned about the situation. However, to improve the situation as much as possible, the government is making its best efforts,"" the statement said.

&gt; There were more than 3,700 people on the ship when it arrived off the Japanese coast last week, but those diagnosed with the disease have been taken off the boat, along with some people suffering other health conditions requiring medical attention.

&gt; Ten of those hospitalised are now in serious condition, Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said on Friday.

&gt; Excluding the cases on the ship, and an infected quarantine officer, Japanese authorities have so far diagnosed 33 people with the newly named COVID-19.

&gt; The newly diagnosed cases include a woman in her 80s whose positive test result emerged after she died in hospital.

&gt; The woman was reportedly the mother-in-law of a taxi driver in Tokyo who has also been diagnosed with the virus.

&gt; DOCTOR, PATIENT INFECTED

&gt; A doctor in Wakayama prefecture and a patient treated in the hospital where the doctor worked have also been diagnosed.

&gt; Officials in the region said they were still not sure if the doctor had infected the patient.

&gt; ""It is difficult to trace the route of the infection"", governor Yoshinobu Nisaka told reporters.

&gt; He said officials were asking people in the area ""to report suspicious cases of pneumonia so that we can immediately conduct tests"".

&gt; The hospital has been closed to visitors and medical staff are now being tested for the virus, Nisaka added.

&gt; Despite the new infections, government officials sought to play down concerns about the spread of the virus in Japan.

&gt; ""There is not enough epidemiological evidence to suggest that the epidemic is spreading inside Japan,"" government spokesman Yoshihide Suga told reporters.

&gt; ""We will keep collecting epidemiological information including on the routes of infection.""

&gt; The Diamond Princess has been quarantined off Japan since early February after it emerged a former passenger who got off the boat in Hong Kong had tested positive for the virus.

&gt; The quarantine is due to end on Feb 19 and those on the ship have been mostly confined to their cabins and asked to wear masks and keep their distance from other passengers during brief outings on open deck.

&gt; Crew on board have expressed concern that their conditions-- including shared cabins, bathrooms and workspaces - put them at greater risk of contracting the virus.

&gt; On Friday afternoon, the crew distributed iPhones to passengers on board, with the captain saying the handsets had been sent by the Japanese government.

&gt; ""We are distributing iPhones to all staterooms, loaded with an application ... (that) will help you to get medical support. Full instructions will be distributed together with the phones,"" he said.

&gt; Japan has evacuated hundreds of its citizens from Hubei, the Chinese province where the virus emerged, and officials said a fifth flight would be sent to bring people home on Sunday.

3,"He says the elderly should stay home. I have to look up how old he is-looks like he should qualify. 


DALTON, Ga. — Dalton Mayor David Pennington told the Dalton Daily Citizen newspaper on Thursday that he considers dramatic steps taken to stop the spread of the COVID-19 virus is ""hysteria.""

The mayor's quote appears near the end of an article with the headline ""Restaurants move to delivery, curbside pickup to woo conoravirus-wary customers.""

The paper quotes Pennington as saying he still dines out, and is disappointed to see so few people.

""I was at (Cyra's) Tuesday, took some city people down there,"" he said. ""We were the only people in the restaurant. I go to the Oakwood every morning. Normally, there's a bunch of people on the side I sit on. Now, I'm the only one on that side. This is hysteria. I don't deny that vulnerable people need to self-quarantine — the elderly, people with heath conditions. but the rest of us don't,"" Pennington is quoted as saying.
NewsChannel 9 has reached out to Pennington's office for comment on this story, and we will share his response once we hear back.

As of Saturday at 12 p.m., there is one confirmed case of COVID-19 in Whitfield County. Hamilton Medical Center announced the case on Wednesday. In response, Whitfield County leaders declared a State of Emergency in response to the positive case. That declaration curtailed Whitfield County government services to its citizens, particularly cancelling in-person visits and closing public buildings that are non-essential. Restaurants and bars were not mentioned in the county's State of Emergency declaration.

On Thursday, Georgia Governor Brian Kemp updated Georgians on his efforts to contain the virus. Earlier in the week, Kemp declared a statewide State of Emergency, urging all public schools to close for the time being.

While that update from Kemp did not specifically address going out to a restaurant to dine in, it does say ""To stop the spread of coronavirus, we must follow the guidance from federal and state health organizations and leaders: regularly wash your hands, practice social distancing, protect the elderly and chronically ill, and stay home, especially if you are sick. If you are experiencing symptoms consistent with COVID-19, call your doctor or an urgent care clinic. Do not show up at the emergency room or your doctor’s office unannounced.""

The Atlanta Journal Constitution reports that during an interview on radio station Q99.7, Kemp said he “can’t just shut things [like restaurants] down,"" because he's trying to avoid a public overreaction.

The governor went on to say that he is not currently seeking relief incentives from the state for struggling businesses, but still asks Georgians to keep supporting small businesses and restaurants.



In a video posted Wednesday to his official Facebook page, Kemp stood in front of a table filled with fast food from Atlanta’s iconic Varsity restaurant in Midtown. He encouraged people to order takeout and delivery from Georgia restaurants to practice social distancing.

On Thursday, Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms announced on Twitter that she has signed an executive order limiting restaurants to take-out service, closing bars, gyms, and other areas of gathering.

Local cities, including Chattanooga, East Ridge and Soddy-Daisy, have now instituted a ban on dine-in options for all local restaurants, with options still available for take-out and delivery. Gyms and fitness centers in all three of those communities are also closed (with those restrictions going into effect in Soddy-Daisy at midnight on Saturday).

We have reached out to Mayor Pennington for comment. If and when we hear back from him, we will update this story.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
4,"&gt; A couple of million wont die in the US.

It's very, very possible. I'm not trying to be an alarmist here, I'm trying to be a realist. I would be EXTREMELY surprised if this doesn't kill at least a couple million people in the US.

Experts are saying that up to 70% could be infected - even in countries where they are doing a relatively good job of trying to contain the virus, and doing better testing. The US is not. The government is actively downplaying the virus, telling people to still go to work even if they have it, refusing to institute sick pay/sick days for people who have it, not providing testing and actively preventing it in many cases.

So let's do some math:

* US population is roughly 330 million.
* Up to 70% of people could be infected, but let's REALLY lowball it and say that only 30% of Americans will get the coronavirus, and also assume that nobody who recovers is re-infected. **So for a low estimate let's say 100 million Americans catch the coronavirus.**
* Worldwide mortality rate is about 3.4%. Right now there are 1,281 confirmed cases, 36 deaths, and 15 recoveries in the US. That means that right now, there is a 2.8% death rate in the US - but almost all of those cases are very new, and that 2.8% is assuming that NOBODY who currently has the virus dies from it. If we look at ""resolved cases"", the death rate is like 67% so far (but obviously that will drop a lot). **So let's just assume the death rate of 3.4% worldwide will hold true for the US as well.**
* It will come as a shock to nobody if I saw that the US healthcare system is extremely problematic. Even if you have the utmost faith in US doctors, the reality is that MANY people don't have access to healthcare, and access is far lower than in most other countries. There is also the inevitability that hospitals will be completely overwhelmed and unable to handle the number of incoming cases, which will be true for many countries, not just the US, and will lead to more deaths because people are unable to get care. **But let's be generous and assume that access to healthcare will remain as good as it is now when there are millions of people infected**, so we won't add more deaths to account for that.

----

So: here is a relatively GOOD scenario. 30% of Americans get the virus. 330 million Americans, 100 million Americans infected, 3.4% of those people die. That's 3,400,000 Americans dead.

Here's a worse-case scenario: 70% of Americans get infected (231 million). Hospitals are completely overwhelmed. A small portion of people need emergency treatment and can't get it, they need to be intubated and it's logistically impossible, and they die. Death rate rises to 5%. That's 11,550,000 Americans dead.

To be a bit of a doomsayer: I think that the death rate in MOST countries will probably be higher than it looks now, and that the death rate in the US will be worse as it is now.

&gt; Nobody is doubting that it works, just that human rights are more important than a disease, even if that means people will die.

When we are talking about literally millions of people, I disagree with you. This isn't Patriot Act bullshit, which was based on nothing but fearmongering. This is a very, VERY real situation that is going to kill a lot of people.",0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0
5,"Maybe the people in Singapore don't know but according to a British weekly peer-reviewed general medical journo [The lancet](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30183-5/fulltext).\*the common flu only has an rθ of 1.6\* but the consensus is that based on their scientific model the novel corona virus has a transmission rate of rθ: 2.6 to 3.8 meaning one person can transmit up to 2.6- 3.8 person with a doubling patient time of every 6.9 days if mis-managed or unsupervised, the weekly journal also notes that the mode of transmission is mostly your upper respiratory tract and could go through membranes(i.e.) eyes from infected droplets,(side note [beijing expert](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/3047394/chinese-expert-who-came-down-wuhan-coronavirus-after-saying-it-was) who went into wuhan and told the ccp the virus was (可控) controllable and the virus will be contained inside wuhan. he then got infected shortly after leaving because he forgot to wear eye shield and goggles when visiting the other hospitals that were not suspected to have severe cov positive patients and was only wearing protective clothing and n95 masks).

secondly through your nose a sneeze or a cough or infected droplets mistified by oxygen respirators from a patient could enter your tract. But also related to nose, which is mouth the virus can travel via infected droplets or mistified virus because a virus particle could be  [0.1 microns](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284691618_SARS_Coronavirus_UV_Susceptibility)  and could pass through even n95 masks if ur unlucky, its also worth noting that the food you ingest that are contaminated or having virus on your hands after touching an infected object and rubbing your eyes or touching our mouth will give you the virus as the virus has an attack success rate of 85% meaning don't fucking touch your eyes or mouth before washing ur hands.

lastly the grossest part, it is similar to SARS were one of the symptoms were diarrhea and the virus could get mistified through the flushing process and infect the whole bathroom walls and the next immediate occupant  Lol.(side note again, pregnant mothers who are infected can transmit the virus via birth\*currently unproven whether it was just cross contamination though\*) also some fun fact provided by Germany, a recovered patient can be reinfected again with the virus.

as to the severity of the symptoms like you've asked , it ranges from severe pneumonia where the whole lung is scarred white to just flu like symptoms, it can infect any  age range from newborn infant to 80 year old grand mamas and papas. no one is more or less susceptible to death from the virus as healthy individuals could suddenly come down with pneumonia  without prior respiratory symptoms or cardiac issues and most of the deaths are from cardiac arrest. nor does it really have a preference on what it likes to kill, only two data we have currently of healthy individual's dying was the only hong kong death where the patient who was 39 ([Hkfreepress](https://www.hongkongfp.com/2020/02/04/__trashed-21/)) and was traveling to wuhan in 21st without a mask to visit his relatives and returned in the 23rd before the wuhan city wide quarantine, he was one of the 5 millions who escaped wuhan lockdown, he entered back to hongkong in the 23rd and few days later showed symptoms and later responded positive to the n-cov test and was admitted to the hospital via a taxi, then it was found that he had infected his elderly mother who was 84 as well. in feb 2nd his condition worsened and he succumbed to the wuhan pneumonia at the age of 39.

the second case should be famous by now [of a doctor Li](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iikPfpXl0) who had first discovered sars like symptoms in 7 of his patients and then tried to warn his colleagues on government monitored social media, the state of wuhan wasn't pleased and forced him to sign a letter of admission that he was spreading lies and fear mongering as well as endangering the welfare of his country which carried a 5 year sentence or else [face consequences (here's the translated document by the bbc)](https://imgur.com/a/5coTtXe). he died approximately Wednesday 5th of January 2020 due to cardiac arrest but in an attempt to cover up he was still on oxygen tube despite having no vitals for two days as the state attempted to cover up his death unsuccessfully because two days later he was reported to have died and he had no signs of previous illness as well as being a fit man in his mid thirties.

but outside of these two cases i do not have any hard data on death toll but inside wuhan because the state has stopped being updating the death figures inside wuhan as n-cov virus outside of its original hospitals. i only know that the people of wuhan have [posted online videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U1VYck6KOo) like seeing 8 yellow body  bags and corpses still still having their oxygen tube stuck in while their son lie next to him in his bed crying that hes cant breath and is dying (side note the cameraman was also arrested for disturbing the peace and spreading rumors to cause mass panic) but due to the viral nature of the video and public outcry the local reporter was released. and also videos of china building [death camps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdGjm_94ho4) that have no doctors or nurses to administer any medicine as well as an order that once you enter you wont be getting out. i can only guesstimate the situation in wuhan as being dire and the virus is more serious than what optimistic Singaporeans believes in.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

and a big warning to you all, the incubation period is 90% at 2-14 days more or less with most showing symptoms at 4-7 days and some fringe case were its even longer at a whopping 16 days to show symptoms. these can be called 隱形病人 or asymptomatic patients those still in the incubation period could show virtually no symptoms like cough and the common pneumonia fever but are actually super transmitters in that period due to not knowing they're infected. i hope it was informative and you've learned most of the things about n-cov and it's transmission :D. good luck y'all and  remember wear a mask :))

While Medicare for all promises free healthcare to everyone, if there’s one thing you learn in ECON 101, it’s that there is no free lunch; if you’re not paying for a service, someone else is. Medicare for all is no exception. If implemented, it will not be free — rather it will be financed by real taxpayer money. Medicare for all is estimated to cost more than $32.6 trillion over 10 years. That means an average of $3.26 trillion annually. In fiscal 2016, Medicare and Medicaid combined to cost $1.24 trillion, so under a universal health care system, spending would increase to nearly triple the current amount. However, the federal budget for fiscal year 2019 is $4.41 trillion, so in order to pay for this costly program, we’d need to account for a larger budget of $6.43 trillion. But where would we get an additional $2.02 trillion annually?

The Democrats’ answer to this question seems to be the usual one: the rich will pay. The Democrats would not dare to cut spending for other social programs. They likely wouldn’t even consider cutting Social Security spending by raising the retirement age — which would be a common-sense action as the system will likely go bankrupt by 2034 due to the mass retirement of baby boomers. The programs Democrats have proposed cuts to, especially the military, would simply not yield enough money: U.S. military spending is only $700 billion. Compared to the needed $2 trillion, it’s just a grain of sand in the desert. And at what cost? Such cuts would undermine the security of both the United States and its European allies. The geopolitical situation in the world is already tense, and America cannot risk weakening the defenses of NATO in Europe and around the world.

What’s wrong with the wealthy paying substantially more than the lower and middle class for welfare? The rich are far from being the main recipients of federally subsidized welfare. Raising the taxes for the top bracket to an alarming 52 percent (this is proposed by Senator Sanders (I-Vt.), who caucuses with the Democrats and is one of the main supporters of single-payer health care in America) would force people who don’t benefit from a service to pay more for this service than those who benefit from it. That hardly sounds fair. Worse, taxing the rich too highly deprives people of the incentive to get rich while also driving rich job-creators away from the country. These factors can combine to cause economic stagnation, or worse, a recession — hurting all Americans in the process.

However, if, instead, the U.S. does not raise taxes, the debt accumulation would increase from $1 trillion per annum to $3 trillion. That would mean that in less than 50 years all tax revenue will be spent on paying the debt’s accumulated interest. America would go bankrupt. These are some of the many issues with Medicare for all: it will put every American on one health care insurance standard, which will be mediocre at best, and current proposals don’t answer the questions of how much it will cover and if wealthier people will be able to buy better insurance.Moreover, it would likely murder the health insurance market, driving providers out of business and leaving many people unemployed. Eliminating market competition will cost the country quality insurance. Medicare for all is a simplistic answer to the challenge of achieving universal health care. While it looks good on paper, Medicare for all could have catastrophic consequences. 

So realistically.. no it doesn't change my mind because of the Corona virus. The media needs to learn to stay out of shit. No virus should be downplayed period, but it also shouldn't be used to create mass hysteria. Think of it like bee stings and allergies.. if you're not allergic to bees, it's still gonna hurt being stung but you're less likely to die from it. Where as if you're allergic to bees, you're more like to die or have serious symptoms. I'm more concerned about the people who actually become sick and don't have access to supplies because everyone else is buying it up leaving nothing for the others. Media hype. Why do you need Costco size value packs of toilet paper for a virus that doesn't effect the bowels? Media hype. None of this makes sense to me anyways.. the time frame just seems a bit strange to me. 

So a professor at Harvard was arrested for ties to China, his lab assistant was a high ranking member in the Chinese military, he was given money to setup a lab in Wuhan China. The trade deal that works greatly against China is only paused in a national emergency. Joe Biden's son was on the board of a Chinese company, one of the major reasons no Dem would be voted into office is the economy doing so well. You take a biological weapon and release it into society you can stop a trade deal, manipulate your currency to help crash the economy, spread it to other nations and have the media talk about it non-stop causing mass panic and the U.S. markets to crash and blame it on Trump to hopefully get a Dem elected that cant even remember what fucking office he's running for. . Oh and China is trying to blame it on us and what's the first thing you do if you release a biological weapon into your own country to stop the uprise against your regime? Blame your biggest adversary. Notice how Biden was doing terribly until the rest of them dropped out and he got all their delegates? There's only one way for the Democrats to win the election and that's to hit people in the wallet..which is exactly what's happening right now.

Hence the scaling up, south Korea manufactured 100000 tests in 4 days by copying the WHO recipe, we can do better. Also unlike developed countries, we have stock piles of reagent which we use for RT PCR for TB, some of that can be used, TB can be diagnosed by CBNAAT which has almost equal accuracy

&gt;What should people with hep c, tb etc do until then? Not get treatment because you can't confirm the diagnosis? 

Already explained TB, as far as hep C is concerned, it is diagnosed by serology and EIA, so there won't be any effect if reagents are used for Coronavirus, RT PCR is not a diagnostic test for any disease except Corona, it's only other large scale use is for TB, that too confirmatory but alternatives like CBNAAT are available and widespread.

8,"This week, Emmanuel Macron reinvented himself. In a televised address on the coronavirus epidemic, the man who began his presidency two years ago as a liberal Europeanist reappeared as a Charles de Gaulle-style nationalist. Both the future of France and future of Macron’s presidency rest on how well he negotiates this transformation.

The speech, watched by a record-breaking number of people — some 35 million viewers — was set at the Élysée Palace, against the spare backdrop of a gilded wall and French and European Union flags. Dressed in his habitual blue suit, blue tie and white shirt, Macron spoke for 20 minutes, explaining the precautionary measures the government had already taken and urging the French to obey them. Too many people, he admonished, were still going to markets and parks, restaurants and bars as if “life had not changed.”

But life, he warned, had changed — changed as greatly as it had in times of war. Indeed, this was the speech’s leitmotif: Macron repeated the phrase “We are at war” six times, to underscore not only that France was no longer the same but also that he was no longer the same. “The day after we emerge victorious,” he promised, “will not be like the day before.”

This change becomes clear when we recall Macron’s first two years in power. His persistent effort to scale back the acquis sociaux, or social benefits that French workers had won over the past century, was met by equally persistent resistance. It issued not from France’s shattered and scattered political left, but instead from grass-roots movements like the “yellow vests.” Their weekly protests have faded, but the structural and economic reasons for their disaffection and disconnect remain. His attempt to reform France’s pension system — a series of proposals that included standardizing and raising the retirement age — also resurrected the moribund unions, whose strikes succeeded in paralyzing the nation’s transportation networks for several weeks this past winter.

The government outlasted the strikers, but its victory was Pyrrhic. Even though it retreated on several issues, it ultimately forced through a diluted reform bill with the help of a constitutional article that allows the government to suspend parliamentary debate and enact laws in exceptional circumstances.

Now, that controversy seems to belong to another era. It turns out there are few things like an existential crisis to reboot one’s presidency and persona. In an astonishingly autobiographical passage of his speech, Macron declared: “This period will have taught us a great deal. It has swept away many of our certitudes and convictions, while others will be reexamined. Many things we thought were impossible will happen.”

Against this claim, consider the immediate postwar career of de Gaulle. A conservative Catholic military officer who scorned politics became the leader of a provisional government that adopted a revolutionary political agenda that, among other achievements, nationalized industries and enacted many of the acquis sociaux the unions are now fighting to defend. Like de Gaulle, Macron has pivoted 180 degrees. The Europeanist who was determined to liberalize the economy and rationalize the welfare state has been replaced by a nationalist determined to mobilize the economy and emphasize the need for a resilient welfare system.

This transformation was made clear when Macron affirmed French sovereignty by turning his back on the E.U.’s monetary policy and opening the coffers of the treasury. (On Friday, the E.U. made de jure Macron’s de facto decision by announcing the suspension of its tight budgetary policy.) In essence, Macron insisted that the state — the one largely built by de Gaulle — was ready to pay any price to keep the French safe not just from the viral contagion but also from the spiral of economic disaster. Completing the Gaullist transformation, Macron’s minister of the economy subsequently announced that the government was prepared to nationalize key industries.

If Macron follows through, his speech could prove historic. In terms of style, many commentators have caught echoes of George Clemenceau, who led France during the final years of World War I, while others hear the voice of de Gaulle in his BBC address of June 18, 1940, when he declared the “flame of resistance” still burned in France. While the novel coronavirus is now winning the battle of France, the French would eventually win the war. But as Macron also made clear, victory could be achieved only by a “united” France.

The events that have unfolded since Monday reveal that Macron’s metamorphosis and call to unity have convinced a majority of the French. But there are majorities and there are majorities, and Macron’s is anything but massive. In a poll taken the day after the speech, more than 75 percent found Macron’s words convincing, yet since then a bare majority of French — 54 percent — are satisfied with the government’s handling of the epidemic.

Macron will have to improve on that if he wants to live up to the legacy of de Gaulle.",0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0

&gt;The Los Angeles County Animal Care and Control department announced major changes in operations because of the coronavirus.  
&gt;  
&gt;Officials said its animal control officers would continue to respond to public safety and animal welfare calls, such as dangerous dogs, dead animal reports and animal cruelty investigations, but that the department is deferring less urgent calls until further notice.  
&gt;  
&gt;Pet owners who want to surrender their pets are asked to delay doing so, and those who have found lost pets are asked to foster them temporarily instead of bringing them in.  
&gt;  
&gt;Those who seek to surrender healthy stray cats are asked to release them where they were trapped and bring them in after there is no longer a public health recommendation for social distancing, the department said.  
&gt;  
&gt;Animal care centers are suspending the sale of pet licenses, and pet owners will be given a 30-day grace period for late license submissions.  
&gt;  
&gt;Other county public agencies’ services are also affected by the outbreak. All of the county’s 86 library locations will be closed through the end of the month.  
&gt;  
&gt;“After careful consideration, and discussions with local health authorities, we have decided to close our libraries in an abundance of caution and to help prevent and limit the spread of COVID-19,” said Library Director Skye Patrick in a statement Saturday. “We understand the impact this can potentially cause on customers and will continue to monitor the situation closely to provide updates.”

11,"That's a lie.  But, you don't have to believe me.  Snopes did it's own fact check:  Question to be answered:  Did Trump Administration Fire the US Pandemic Response Team in 2018 to cut costs?  Snopes:  True.

They did.  Quit lying about it.  See, that's a problem with this  administration.  They lied about what they did.  They continue to lie about what is going on now, and why in hell should we believe anything they say now?  What are they going to do?  Say, ""yes we were lying back then, and yes we lied about everything else, but right now we are telling the truth?"" 

You listened to the address -- not a single one of your (my) accounts of what was said was accurate.  Let's see shall we:

Trump:  ""We will be suspending all travel from Europe to the United States for the next 30 days. The new rules will go into effect Friday at midnight. There will be exemptions for Americans who have undergone appropriate screenings.”

Reality:  Ken Cuccinelli - acting Dept. Secty for Homeland Security - three hours later -- Correcting the President -- ""The travel restrictions don’t apply to American citizens or legal permanent residents or their families.”  The President's address created immediate bedlam in Europe as people scambled for tickets out of Europe since the President literally just said they would be there for 30 days.  I have a kid in Europe now -- the day before the State Dept had said that anyone could choose to leave, but it was not necessary.  Then the President spoke and tens of thousands of Americans scrambled to try and get a way out of Europe the next day.  Now, presumably, embassey and others were calling rational people in the admininstration to try and get a handle on what the hell was going on.  It took a few hours and then word came out  that the President was wrong.  Americans could still get back.

2.  The President said:  “These prohibitions will not only apply to the tremendous amount of trade and cargo, but various other things as we get approval. Anything coming from Europe to the United States is what we are discussing.”

This too was just flat out wrong.  Futures markets collapsed.  Market stops were hit, and hit again, and hit again.  See -- people listen to what a President says.  Would the cargo of auto parts on the ship porting in the morning be allowed to unload.  Port authorities needed to know if it applied to ships in port, or just those coming after the speed.  Union officials needed to know if their workers should unload ships.  What happens to goods in cargo planes in transit?  Oops -- sorry.  What he apparently meant to say was ????.  Nothing.  When the markets collapsed and phones blew up someone apparently said -- ""Hey, guess what, business people are pissed.  Maybe we should take back that rule.  Maybe it wasn't a good idea to let Ivanka and Jared and Stephen tell the President what to say.""  Interesting that it actually took less time for the President to say, ""I didn't mean it"" for the European goods statement than to get a correction out about -- you know -- Americans in Europe not being allowed to travel.  That certainly says something about what the President thinks concerning the relative value of people versus trade.  Incidentally, the trade correction came out from the President.  The people correction came from the acting deputy secretary for Homeland Security.  What do you think that says about what the President cares about?

3.  The President said:   “Earlier this week I met with the leaders of the health-insurance industry who have agreed to waive all co-payments for coronavirus treatments.”  Nope.  A spokesperson for the health insurance lobby said:  ""Co-payments for coronavirus testing, not treatments, have been suspended.""  Huge difference, but, of course, we can't get tests anyways, but that is a whole other set of Trump lies.

That's three lies in a 9 minute 30 second address made from the oval office at a time when the American people and the world were on edge.  How important was it?  Well - -markets collapsed within minutes.  People in Europe who the day before were literally told by the state department that this was fine -- not an issue in staying, were now told they had 24 hours to get home or they would have to stay for 30 days unless they passed testing which, today, we still have not figured out.  (Florida, a state of 21.5 million people should breach the 1,000 tests done mark today.  They were over 700 yesterday.)   Literally the day before -- Trump said there was nothing to worry about.

This was an address from the oval office.  It is not a press conference.  It is not a ""hey I was thinking about this"".  The President speaks to the American people and the world from the oval office.  You cannot get things wrong.  You cannot float ideas.  Globally people listen and take immediate action.

The World Health Organization got the initial report from China on December 31, 2019.  It declared a world health emergency on Janaury 30, 2020 -- hey that's one day BEFORE the US stopped Chinese citizens from traveling to the US (but not US citizens or green card holders, or students)

By the time the President gave his address we were already in a crises and had been since no later than January 30.  Thanks to this President and his asinine lack of response -- we are now in full market collapse, city wide lock-downs, and cancellation of schools and colleges across the country and we are staring at numbers right now of somewhere between 1% and 4% of all Americans dying from this disese.  That's 3,200,000 people on the low end.  12,800,000 on the upper end.  A lot depends on the ability to develop, produce and distribute vaccines to everyone -- worldwide. 

Right now -- companies as diverse as Ford and GM are looking at shifting production to making respirators/ventilators for use around the world.  Good for them.  We need to ramp up wartime production if we are going to get through this.  And -- we need someone who is not a bumbling idiot to help lead the country.

b) We have no idea if these studies are applicable to humans, or even *in vivo.*

c) This particular study wasn't even on zinc or zinc tablets (of the sort you find in the ~~Magical Woo Water~~""homeopathic remedy"" section of the store, or even the vitamin section) but [zinc pyrithone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc_pyrithione)\--aka the active ingredient in Head and Shoulders.  (Zinc pyrithone is a pretty good antifungal--one reason it's used in dandruff treatment--and is also an ingredient in some algicides and antibacterial sponges.)

d) In general, zinc supplementation is not recommended for coronavirus treatment (including COVID-19), partly because people have caused themselves injury by ""natural remedies"" that were zinc-based.  (The zinc tablets, you'll be tasting something akin to an orange-flavored penny at best; some people using zinc-impregnated nasal swabs did wreck their sense of smell, which is why those particular products got pulled from the market.)

e) We CERTAINLY do not recommend you drink Head and Shoulders as a treatment or preventative for COVID-19.  (Yes, I know it's ridiculous I note this, but there's probably going to be at least ONE rando who tries it.  You have people who drink industrial bleach as a tonic, so you can't assume people WON'T try the H&amp;S Cure at least once.)  

f) If you're worried about zinc deficiency in your diet (which is a very, very much separate issue to ""Will the active ingredient in Head and Shoulders kill COVID-19 in vivo, and possibly also cure flaky scalp?"")...meat, shellfish, legumes (chickpeas, lentils, beans, peanuts/groundnuts) especially sprouted or fermented, certain seeds (hempseed, flaxseed, ""squash family"" seeds like squash and pumpkin, and sesame seeds), tree nuts and pine nuts, dairy, eggs, whole grains, some veggies (particularly regular and sweet potatoes), and dark chocolate are all good sources of zinc in the diet.  

g) I should also note that a lot of chiropractors and vitamin and mineral peddlers--especially the sort that tend to sell via multi-level marketing--tend to push a LOT of claims that ""most people suffer vitamin and mineral deficiencies"" when...most people in Western countries don't; often they'll claim there's some subclinical vitamin/mineral deficiency, especially with trace elements.

In the US, [the main people who have to worry about zinc deficiency](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Zinc-Consumer/) are people who've had bariatric surgery or who have serious digestive disorders (like Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis); vegans (ovo-lacto vegetarians and pescetarians, including Rastafarians who follow Ital living, generally get enough zinc from the diet), infants above six months of age who are breastfeeding, alcoholics (who also get all kinds of other deficiency disorders), and sickle cell disease.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
13,"I *love* how we are incentivizing those who are best place to spread the disease to avoid testing and come to work even if they are not well...

Think about it. Who in Australia has no sick leave or annual leave? Our casual and contract workers unless they are lucky enough to work for Uber or Woolies. 

These people are:

1. More likely to be young (and therefore unlikely to develop complications from covid 19, and do not have access to a lot of the grandfathered social welfare programs like not having to work for the dole or meals on wheels).

2. More likely to work in industries like child care, hospitality, retail, food service or other, public facing roles. I don't know about you, but I would much rather the person making my sandwich, cleaning my office building, looking after my kids or pouring my drinks, be able to afford to stay home if they were sick. But that's not how things are in Australia.

3. More likely to be financially insecure- missing 2 weeks of work would likely be financially catastrophic, and even if they didn't lose their job, might result in starvation, homelessness or other catastrophic consequences. These people earn too much for concession cards but not enough for financial stability. They likely have to use public transport (good luck with that whole social distancing thing) and would not have either the financial or social capital to have all their needs met while in quarantine (meals on wheels won't deliver toilet paper or food to your door if you are not permanently disabled or elderly).

We've screwed over our poor young people. They are stuck between a rock and a hard place - they have *no* incentive to do the right thing other than guilt and social obligation. Indeed, if they do the right thing, they will suffer.

15,"[This article in the New Statesman seems good](https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/health/2020/03/why-uk-s-approach-coronavirus-such-risk). Says that whilst we will probably look back at it and say our early failures in testing prevented containment of the virus, from where we are now we can only really control and Britains strategy is bold and intelligent (though not without risks). Though it focuses a little too much on the herd immunity thing, which is more just a cosnequence of the government's plan (if any substantial immunity is available), but not the main plan itself, but it does explain why the government is using this strategy rather than stricter quarantines. 

&gt;One of my favourite aphorisms concerns two archetypal doctors – one a surgeon, the other a physician – confronted by a patient with a life-threatening emergency. “Don’t just stand there, do something!” shouts the surgeon. “Don’t just do something, stand there,” the physician replies.

&gt;Originally a humorous encapsulation of the different character traits typifying these two very different branches of medicine – surgeons, decisive people of action; physicians, cerebral theorists – it strikes me the aphorism could be repurposed to describe the divergence in the management of the coronavirus pandemic emerging between the UK and the rest of the world.

&gt;Numerous other countries, many with far fewer confirmed cases than us, are imposing restrictions on the gathering and daily movement of their people, as well as banning immigration. The UK did have its own case-based containment phase, but last week it officially shifted to a delay phase. At present this consists largely in voluntary efforts: self-isolation in the event of respiratory symptoms; good hygiene practices; and a degree of social distancing and home-working.

&gt;This approach has received widespread criticism, including from professor John Ashton, a former regional director of public health, and from senior figures in the World Health Organisation. These are not voices to be dismissed lightly. And faced with a serious public health threat, it does feel unnerving not to be employing stringent counter-measures. Surely we should be closing schools and universities, limiting travel and public events? (A ban on mass gatherings is expected from next week.) Shouldn’t everyone with a temperature or cough be being tested? That would feel like we were doing something. And in some countries, such as China, South Korea, and Singapore, these kinds of approaches have brought new case numbers down impressively.

&gt;Dealing with this pandemic is going to be a marathon, however, not a sprint. Underpinning UK strategy is the conviction that the virus is not eradicable by containment. Covid-19 is a perfect storm of a pathogen. It causes minor enough illness in most patients to make it hard to detect and therefore isolate every case, meaning it spreads itself very effectively. Once strict population-based containment measures – which severely curtail normal life and are not sustainable long-term – are lifted and people start travelling and mixing again, it won’t be long before coronavirus resurges. 

&gt;Superimposed on this is the tendency for viral infections to come in waves, typically peaking in winter months. And unlike the 2009 pandemic of swine flu, which had an exceptionally low mortality rate (around 0.02 per cent), Covid-19 has the capacity to send at least 5 per cent of affected people into intensive care, many of whom won’t survive. The accounts coming out of Italy this past week are a chilling demonstration of what happens to a health system hit by a sudden surge of critical cases – it has been utterly overwhelmed.

&gt;If coronavirus can’t be eradicated by containment, and if, unchecked, it will completely outstrip our capacity to care for serious cases, then the best way of managing it is to gain some control over the timing and rate of the inevitable infections. This is the UK’s ambitious strategy – to flatten and draw out the first wave.

&gt;Think of coronavirus cases as water flowing through a hose. Population-based containment would be like pinching the pipe so hard that you shut it off completely, but the force required can’t be maintained forever; soon muscles fatigue and cramp, and the water starts up again. What the UK is attempting is to regulate the flow. At present the water pressure (new case numbers) is low, so relatively little force is needed to limit the flow rate – these are our current low-key tactics. As water pressure rises, the hose needs to be squeezed harder to keep the flow rate controlled – these will be the institutional closures, event cancellations, and travel restrictions we’re told may come.

&gt;If successful, the UK will reach next winter with a substantial proportion of the population immune to Covid-19, while having maintained the capacity to care for severely affected patients in intensive care units along the way. The anticipated second wave next winter will be dramatically attenuated. 

&gt;But there are huge uncertainties. No country has ever tried to regulate the rate of a pandemic in this way before. And assumptions about acquired immunity may be upturned should Covid-19 – the biology of which is still largely unknown – prove itself capable of mutating to evade the immune system as influenza routinely does.

&gt;When we look back, I suspect we will see our rigid initial case definition – based purely on travel history or known contact with a confirmed case – and attendant restriction on testing as having fatally undermined our case-based attempt at containment. But given where we are now, our strategy of trying to control what is inevitably approaching strikes me as both bold and intelligent. It is not without risk, though, and only in time will we know whether it was the right choice.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

18,"Right, I agree with almost everything you write here. We have come to believe recessions and depressions are inevitable, but I believe they aren't inevitable. 

This latest recession, like others before it, was due to greed run rampant. Rampant Greed isn't inevitable.

Tax laws have been written which allow money made via investment in the stock market to be be taxed less than money earned. This is particularly advantages to the Investor Class.

Many CEOs are chosen by boards because they are willing to pump most Company profits into the stock market. 

They are rewarded by receiving big bonuses in stock which often (generally?) far outstrip their salaries. So for instance a CEO might make 1.5 million in salary while receiving 20 million in stock. 

The more the company stock goes up, the greater the CEOs personal compensation.  Also the greater the compensation for all investors, like Warren Buffet, etc. 

I wrote that obvious fact to lead to this... The stock market isn't just the happy recipient of almost every drop of Company profit, it is also being goosed with low interest loans readily available to those esteemed Mega-Corps. 

So why not take out massive loans of `nearly' free money and put them into stock buy backs? After all such a practice makes the CEO richer, and it makes the board, representing the investor class (like Buffett), smile. The Company looks golden to others who then put their money (or money they have borrowed), into the market.

It's win win win right? 

 We have had a historic number of years of low cost money now and never before have our Corporations been so leveraged for the benefit of so few (only 10% own 80% of the stock).

 When a market is so debt based even a sneeze (from Coronavirus for instance) can send investors running for the exits.

 Are unfortunate events like a pandemic inevitable? Sure, however, the pandemic itself isn't the cause of collapse. It's the weakened state of being highly leveraged which renders Corporations unable to weather any vicissitude which causes the collapse. 

It caused failure in the late 1920s, in the 80's, in 2000, in 2007-8 and apparently again in 2020! Do we never learn? 

Ah well, why should they learn? The Bankers and Corporations aren't too fearful of being so leveraged because they can count on the American taxpayer to bail them out to the tune of, well, whatever it takes...no one ever seems to ask how we'll pay for that. We'll just do it... 

Why? 

Because our Legislators have been bought and paid for by these Corporate entities.

 Our younger generation have been caught into a life destroying debt trap, forced there, not by greed, but by necessity. They had to pay the excessive costs of higher education in order to get jobs that didn't amount to flipping burgers. 

Simultaneously, these Corporations were getting money for nearly free, students were paying interest rates of 7-8%. When, through no fault of their own, students can't pay back their loans, they are treated ruthlessly while CEOs, who've padded their personal wealth based in pumping &gt;all&lt; profits into the market and precariously leveraging the Company via gargantuan loans, again to enhance their bottom lines even more obscenely get bailed out. 

Is this inevitable?

No...

When Investment Banking was well regulated and Corporate Monopoly laws were enforced America enjoyed a time of steady, stable growth of middle class incomes and well-being. So, these kinds of booms and busts *aren't* inevitable. 

How long will this continue? 

As long as campaign finance laws allow the Wealthiest to buy our legislators. As long as the American people remain naive to what is going on. 

How can it be fixed? 

We need an FDR type of leader who can put together a team of real geniuses like Robert Reich and others who can craft a game plan going forward. A game plan NOT based in Corporate greed, but rather based in what is good for Society in general.

&amp;#x200B;

Margaret Sullivan 

Media columnist

March 11, 2020 at 2:25 p.m. CDT

The insidious feedback loop between President Trump and Fox News is no secret.

&amp;#x200B;

When Trump says “jump,” the network leaps into action. And what the president hears on Fox News often dictates his own pronouncements and policies — which, in turn, are glowingly represented in Fox News’s coverage and commentary.

&amp;#x200B;

That’s never been anything short of dangerous, since the effect has been to create a de facto state-run media monster more devoted to maintaining power than shedding light on the truth. But now the mind-meld of Fox News and Trump is potentially lethal as Trump plays down the seriousness of the coronavirus and, hearing nothing but applause from his favorite information source for doing so, sees little reason to change.

&amp;#x200B;

There’s one person who could transform all that in an instant: Fox founder Rupert Murdoch, the Australian-born media mogul who, at 89, still exerts his influence on the leading cable network — and thus on the president himself.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Chris Wallace, the independent and tough-minded Fox News interviewer who serves as the network’s chief reality officer, has revealed that the executive chairman of News Corp and co-chairman of Fox Corporation likes to give feedback on what he sees on the network.

&amp;#x200B;

“He cares tremendously about the news,” Wallace said, according to the Guardian. “When I have contact with him, he never is asking about ideology, just: ‘What’s going on? What’s happening? Tell me.’ ”

&amp;#x200B;

That’s a little hard to believe, given the network’s long history of Clinton-bashing and birtherism lies about Barack Obama, and its peddling of conspiracy theories. But Murdoch’s ultimate power at the network is not in question.

&amp;#x200B;

So imagine if the word flowed down from on high that Fox News should communicate to Trump that he needs to take an entirely new tack on the virus. Imagine if Murdoch ordered the network to end its habit of praising him as if he were the Dear Leader of an authoritarian regime and to instead use its influence to drive home the seriousness of the moment.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Would it matter? No doubt.

&amp;#x200B;

The network’s influence on Trump is clear from the presidential tweets that follow fast on the heels of a Fox News broadcast. He was always a fan of Fox News, but after entering the White House, he made it even more of an obsessive daily habit, Bloomberg News reported in 2017, to the extent of blotting out dissenting voices from other sources.

&amp;#x200B;

Trump made specific reference to his reliance on Fox News during his misleading press event Friday, when he offered unwarranted reassurance rather than urging extreme caution and decisive action: “As of the time I left the plane . . . we had 240 cases — that’s at least what was on a very fine network known as Fox News.”

&amp;#x200B;

The message: Go about your business, America, and it will all disappear soon.

&amp;#x200B;

Days later, 30 deaths and more than 1,000 cases have been reported in the United States, with those numbers expected to grow exponentially. (By contrast, German Chancellor Angela Merkel is telling hard truths: As much as 70 percent of that country could end up being infected.)

&amp;#x200B;

AD

&amp;#x200B;

Matt Gertz, a Media Matters senior fellow and the foremost chronicler of the insidious Trump-Fox News feedback loop, connected the dots: “Roughly an hour before his comments, a Fox News medical correspondent argued on-air that coronavirus was no more dangerous than the flu; a few hours later, the same correspondent argued that coronavirus fears were being deliberately overblown in hopes of damaging Trump politically.”

&amp;#x200B;

He added: “The network's personalities have frequently claimed that the Trump administration has been doing a great job responding to coronavirus, that the fears of the disease are overblown, and that the real problem is Democrats and the media politicizing the epidemic to prevent Trump's reelection.”

&amp;#x200B;

On Fox Business Channel, host Trish Regan drew widespread condemnation for her over-the-top rant in Trump's defense: “The chorus of hate being leveled at the president is nearing a crescendo as Democrats blame him and only him for a virus that originated halfway around the world. This is yet another attempt to impeach the president.”

&amp;#x200B;

AD

&amp;#x200B;

(By contrast, her Fox News colleague Tucker Carlson has taken the threat seriously, though using it as an excuse to stoke anti-China sentiment along the way.)

&amp;#x200B;

Tucker Carlson issues a dire coronavirus warning. His audience expects nothing less.

&amp;#x200B;

But it’s not just the opinionators such as Regan and Trump whisperer Sean Hannity who are at fault. The news segments — while certainly more tied to reality — seldom push back in a meaningful way against the Trump message.

&amp;#x200B;

On Tuesday, news anchors Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum docilely sat back and lobbed soft questions while the president’s son Eric praised his father’s crisis-management skills and blamed liberal media figures who criticize him: “He could cure cancer tomorrow and they’d say it wasn’t fast enough.”

&amp;#x200B;

Even if all that changed today, great harm has already been done. As The Washington Post and others have documented, the administration has repeatedly squandered chances to prepare for and manage the global epidemic.

&amp;#x200B;

AD

&amp;#x200B;

But every moment still counts. Lives can be saved by prudent practices and aggressive government action — and lost by their absence.

&amp;#x200B;

But it takes leadership from the top. And so, let’s acknowledge the obvious: There is no more important player in influencing Trump than Fox News. And no more powerful figure at Fox than its patriarch.

&amp;#x200B;

Murdoch might consider, too, that with the median age of Fox’s viewers around 65, they are among the most vulnerable to the virus’s threats.

As of this writing (10am cst Tuesday) Minnesota's COVID-19 infection count stands at 235, with 17 hospitalizations.

I think I will take this moment to quote the Lt. Governor as the Star Tribune did on the event:

&gt;“To many, he’ll be a statistic: Tennessee’s second COVID-related death. But to me, I’ll remember a loving, older brother, uncle, father, and husband,” Flanagan wrote in an Instagram post Sunday.

&gt; “If you feel fine, that’s great. But please consider the possibility that you’re carrying the virus and don’t know it, and then you walk past the next Ron, my big brother, in public,” she wrote. “COVID-19 now has a personal connection to me. Please do all you can to prevent one for you.”

Coronavirus has even personally affected Governor Tim Walz - Monday morning he announced on Twitter that he would lead by example and work from home in self quarantine for the next two weeks after learning he was exposed to coronavirus by a member of his security detail.

Look at the math.  Look at the graphs.  Look at other countries experience.  [Look at this interactive graph](https://www.nytimes.com./interactive/2020/03/13/opinion/coronavirus-trump-response.html).  

#***Please take 5 minutes, and look at the math below:***

Virologists and Epidemiologists from Harvard and John's Hopkins are saying that anywhere from 40% to 60% of the population of the US will contract COVID19.

They also say, and you can see from other countries, that roughly 5-6% need ventilators.

Let's use low-end and say 40% of the US contracts COVID19 and 5% of those need ventilators.

40% x 327,000,000 (pop of US) = 130,800,000 will contract COVID19 on the low-end.

5% of those cases (5% x 130,800,000) = 6,540,000 will need ventilators.

The USA has about 170,000 ventilators, with roughly 200,000 in the national stockpile. This is roughly 370,000 ventilators nation-wide.

We all know there are people nation wide that are currently on ventilators. I don't know how many, so let's just assume for the math, that EVERY SINGLE VENTILATOR IN THE COUNTRY is available, even though this definitely isn't true:

6,540,000 people who need ventilators - 370,000 available ventilators = 6,170,000.

#Left with NO CONTAINMENT and no additional supply of ventilators from other countries, this virus WOULD HAVE killed roughly 6,170,000 people by the end of it, on the low-end.

So we're supposedly social distancing right now (even though I see people at the bars, and out and about everywhere). Let's take that into account:

Say we're actually doing some good with our social distancing, and it removes 4/5 of every case.

(1/5) x 6,170,000 = 

#If our hospitals are over run, roughly 1,234,000 people that will die from this disease this year, ONLY from lack of ventilators...and this assumes every ventilator in the country is available currently. On the low end.

...and that's even if our ""social distancing"" is removing 4/5 of the infected possibilities.

...and this isn't even mentioning the people who need ICU beds, but DON'T need ventilators.

You may not like to hear it, and frankly neither do I, but it's time to hunker down. Nation wide.

Europe’s dismal opening signals a difficult week for markets.
Global financial markets on Monday began a perilous week, as the relentless spread of the coronavirus and a clash among the world’s biggest oil producers rattle investors.

European stocks plunged early on Monday, with London and Frankfurt stock markets opening 8 percent lower. Paris and other European exchanges were close behind, echoing sentiment in the Asia-Pacific region, where markets ended sharply lower.

Wall Street looked set to follow, according to futures markets.

Government bonds signaled that investors wanted the security of a safe harbor, as yields on U.S. government debt fell to new lows. Gold, the tried-and-true indicator of investor skittishness, rose.
OUTBREAK UPDATES Read the latest on the fight against the coronavirus.
Oil prices lost nearly a quarter of their value in futures markets, as two major producers, Saudi Arabia and Russia, set off a price war while the world’s thirst for crude is already ebbing. While low oil prices can give consumers a boost, they can also disrupt countries that depend heavily on petroleum dollars to keep their economies running.
World markets were already shaken by the near-shutdown of China in January, as the new coronavirus began spreading beyond the center of the city of Wuhan. Even before the weekend’s developments, stocks in the United States had fallen by more than 10 percent over the past month, as measured by the S&amp;P 500 stock index.

The problem globally is growing worse.

On Sunday, Italy took the dramatic step of locking down a large chunk of its industrial northern region. In the United States, a top government disease expert warned that regional lockdowns there might become necessary, though he played down the idea of tight quarantines like the kind China has enacted.

Bruno Le Maire, the French finance minister, on Monday called for a big economic stimulus plan for Europe to counter the impact of the outbreak.

Investors in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region showed on Monday that they see the problems getting worse before they get better.

The Frankfurt and London exchanges made up some modest ground from their difficult opening. The FTSE 100 index in London was 6.3 percent lower later in the morning. while Germany’s DAX was down 5.8 percent.

Paris stocks were trading more than 6 percent lower. An index of Europe’s 50 biggest companies was down more than 6 percent.

Those holding money in Asia had already voted with their feet, fleeing stocks across the region. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 index fell more than 5 percent, after economic data released Monday morning suggested the country’s economic slump at the end of last year was worse than expected.

Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index tumbled 4.2 percent. In China, the Shanghai Composite Index lost 3.1 percent. South Korea’s Kospi fell 4.2 percent. The biggest drop in the Asia-Pacific region was in Australia, where the S&amp;P/ASX 200 index dropped more than 7 percent.

Futures markets suggested Wall Street would open 5 percent lower.

In bonds, yields on the closely watched 10 year U.S. Treasury bond fell below 0.5 percent, about half the level of just a week ago.

In oil markets, futures tracking West Texas Intermediate crude fell to about $32 a barrel, down more than 20 percent after Saudi Arabia declared it would cut prices.
Analysts warned that if Saudi Arabia failed to reach an agreement with Russia on oil prices soon, it could trigger not only a further spiraling in oil prices but also prompt contagion across financial markets.

“Another acute shock to markets in the midst of a prior air pocket,” said Bhanu Baweja, a UBS strategist, in a note to investors. He predicted the volatility in the markets could pull the S&amp;P 500 index down as low as 2650 points, a more than one-year low. The index is currently trading  around 2819 points.

I find these types of probabilities much easier to reason about by starting with the entire population &amp; narrowing from there. There are around 1k-10k of in the US with the coronavirus right now (pessimistically, let's say 10k). As a wild approximation, we'll say that ~500k people in the US have the flu right now (based on ~10 million getting it a year). Now, suppose that the only things that cause a fever are the flu &amp; coronavirus and that we want to diagnose someone that has a fever. Even if all coronavirus cases and only 20% of flu cases develop a fever, that leaves us with 10k people with (coronavirus &amp; fever) and 100k people with (flu &amp; fever), meaning that if all we know is someone has a fever that it's much more likely (~10:1) that they have the flu than the coronavirus. This [symptom chart](https://i.insider.com/5e6a58e684159f61963287a2?width=700&amp;format=jpeg&amp;auto=webp) seems informative.

This type of problem is [conditional probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_probability) ""the probability of X given that Y is true"", typically written P(X | Y). The key insight is that P(X | Y) and P(Y | X) are not particularly related, especially when P(X) and P(Y) are of significantly different sizes. This is a common enough mistake to have a [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_of_the_inverse). For instance, imagine how ""is very wealthy - top 0.1%"" and ""owns a house"" interact. By definition P(rich) = 0.1%. At a guess, say P(house) ~= 50%. Almost all very wealthy people own a house: P(house | rich) ~= 99%, but it's obviously not the case that almost all people that own a house are very wealthy: P(rich | house) ~= 0.2%. To stay on theme, P(hungry | stoned) is a lot higher than P(stoned | hungry).

In this case, P(fever | covid) is high (~88%), but our initial estimate of P(covid) is so low compared to P(flu) that observing a fever isn't enough to convince us that someone with a fever has covid - P(covid | fever) isn't that high. On the other hand, while P(shortness of breath | covid) &lt; P(covid | fever), P(shortness of breath | flu) is much, much lower, so P(covid | shortness of breath &amp; fever) is much, much higher than is intuitive.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Government is prioritising economy over health of a nation.

We should close schools and go into lockdown now like many other countries to flatten the curve. The **following medical experts have urged government to close our schools**:

* Business for Doctors ""almost unanimous"" opinion of their 27,500 members. Founder, April Armstrong, a Western Australian GP, said ""Doctors are putting family in isolation now. We are taking our children out of school now. We're telling all our family and friends to stay at home and the reason we're telling them to stay at home is that trajectory \[of COVID-19 cases\] is going to be really steep.""
* Medical Journal of Australia editor-in-chief Nick Talley called for the government to impose stricter social-distancing measures to slow the spread of the virus. ""It is very hard to see the curve flattening out with what we’re doing. It’s community transmission and it’s fairly widespread,"" Professor Talley said.
* Dan Suan, a staff immunologist at Westmead Hospital in Sydney's inner west, also warned his Facebook followers that Australia had only a narrow window of opportunity to flatten the curve of new infections, recommending total social isolation, complete interpersonal distancing and massively increased testing.
* Australian Medical Association WA president Andrew Miller said research from China showed intervening in community gatherings and **closing schools had an “amazing effect” in reducing coronavirus infections – a week's delay in bringing in closures could see an increase of up to three times the amount of cases**.
* Intensive care specialist Greg Kelly consulted with intensive care colleagues  at several major hospitals in Melbourne and Sydney and now has petition of over 3,5000 doctors urging government to implement strict lockdown

Currently we have 877 cases and they are doubling every 4 days. If we continue with current growth rate by 8/4/202 our healthcare system will run out of capacity, we will be overwhelmed as we will run out of capacity of ICU beds, ventilators and medical specialists.

If we have no intervention and stay with current exponential growth rate then Australia can expect 25,000,000/100,000 x 20 deaths per day = 5,000 deaths per day by June based on epidemic modeling group at Imperial College London:

**The person in charge of the square cabin hospital tells the inside facts**


[NTD Beijing, February 06, 2020] The pneumonia epidemic in Wuhan has rapidly expanded. Recently, Wuhan has rushed to build three "" square cabin hospitals "" overnight . Lead to cross-infection with more serious consequences. On the 6th, a video was uploaded on Twitter. A person in charge of the suspected Fangcai Hospital personally told the truth. Some netizens said that the explanation was plain, the Fangcai Hospital was a funeral home , and they died here when they entered. They could not come out.


As the epidemic situation in Wuhan continues to deteriorate, beds in major hospitals are difficult to find, and many patients cannot be treated. In addition to the temporary ""Vulcan Mountain Hospital"" and ""Thunder Mountain Hospital"" previously built, Wuhan rushed to build three nights on February 3. "" Fang cabin hospital "" is specially used to treat diagnosed mild patients.

The three ""cabin hospitals"" are Wuhan International Convention and Exhibition Center, Wuhan Hongshan Gymnasium and Wuhan Living Room, with a total of more than 4,000 beds. However, the ""hospital"" has neither isolation protection facilities nor medical equipment.

Some netizens said: ""I'm afraid that I can get in such a place, and I can't get out!"" Some netizens worry: ""I'm afraid the virus inside will mutate again."" ""The medical care here is dangerous.""

On February 6, a netizen posted a video on his Twitter account and attached a post, ""The person in charge said: Fangcai Hospital is not a hospital at all, there are no medical facilities in it, and it does not accept people with severe illness or mobility problems. And when you go in, you can't come out ... To put it bluntly, the Fangcang Hospital is a funeral parlour . The patients received here will no longer be treated, just wait for death! ""


Many netizens have commented on this video and said, ""Everyone is lying together waiting for the collective killing of the dead hospital.""

""If you have a mild patient, if you don't let go of the worsening treatment, you just have to wait for death.""

""It's a temporary dormitory, okay. Call the crematorium for temporary expansion.""

""A demon has built a slaughterhouse, and it is very difficult to tell everyone that this is the slaughterhouse. The onlookers asked the devil: Can you accept me? The devil still said in dilemma: fast to die and not to die. You can only collect people who are likely to die. If you come in together and wait for death, you will not let them out. If you are not mentally disabled, you will be angry and sad and wait for a hammer! ""

Another Twitter netizen posted a WeChat screenshot sent by a patient from Wuzhan Fangcai Hospital . The WeChat patient said that he entered the Fangcai hospital in the early morning of February 6, 1,000 confirmed patients, a toilet, someone has urinated anywhere, Spitting. Now a lot of people are talking about dying and dying at home, and now they don't know how they died. We are sick and have not sinned!


On the 6th, a netizen's post on Weibo also disclosed the actual situation of Wuzhan Fangfang Hospital . The post said: My aunt is a newly diagnosed patient with new coronary pneumonia in Qiaokou District. She was sent to a private hospital for isolation and treatment at 9 pm yesterday, and was woken up at 3 am to say that she was sent to a large hospital with better conditions. Arrived at Wuzhan Fangcai Hospital. The conditions here are very poor, which is not exactly what the news says.

The post said: The hospital's electrical wires were short-circuited and blacked out, the electric blankets were unavailable, and they slept with chills at night; One thousand people shared a toilet, and no one cleaned it. The patient's feces spilled out of the pit; breakfast was served at 10 o'clock in the morning, a few small snacks, and the Chinese food was unknown.

I haven't seen doctors and nurses registering their illnesses and giving out medicines. They have limited manpower and they can't get busy. The oxygen inhalation equipment is seriously lacking. There is no bottle of oxygen in the ward of hundreds of people. In this case the patient's condition will only worsen. I implore the government to improve the conditions as soon as possible. Don't take it lightly because the patient is currently mild, and mild patients also have human rights! Everyone wants to live!


In response to criticism from outsiders ’hospitals, Mr. Zhang, a netizen in Wuhan, told NTD:“ It will be repaired in a few days. This is the so-called Communist Party ’s effort to run this kind of hospital. The hospital has no equipment and no There are no protective facilities, no treatment facilities, and no medical equipment. They just isolated him and waited for death. It was a death camp. ""


It is reported that from February 4th, Wuhan will build another 8 ""cabin hospitals"". In addition, there are 20 ""square cabin hospitals"" from all over the country who are helping Wuhan and mobilizing 2,000 medical staff across the country.

Wuhan netizen Mr. Tu said, ""There are too many people infected, and then the hospital is not enough. This is the only way, but the effect of this isolation is not very good.""

He also said, ""The period of high incidence is almost coming. The government must have concealed it. There must be hundreds of thousands of cases across the country. The government does not dare to report it. Who dares to say it. If you say it, he said you made a rumor. He can detain you, often seeing a lot of people telling the truth and then being detained. The dictatorship and one-party dictatorship are too terrible. ""

40,"Just my personal reasons:  


1. Being an unwilling participant in the rat race, and as a possible consequence burn out. It really just sucks that for the vast majority of the working populace, more than 50% of our waking time (from a per week perspective) has to be spent for work purposes. When taking into account other arguably necessary activities such as sleeping, morning exercise, chores, and main meals, there's such precious little free time to just let your mind wonder and simply do nothing that I'll be damned if I use that time to do something useful.  
Other unnoticed things like work prep, commute to work, and the added delay due to context switching involved between each of these activities per weekday also add up, and the cost isn't just the time lost, but also the physical and mental energy required to do them. I get that one can see these as opportunities for their self improvement (e.g. learn a foreign language during commute, or learn something useful whilst on the job), but it would never be as flexible or as optimal (at least for me) as just doing that from home, with a fresh mental state unmarred by work prep or commute.  
I know that there are some who manage to avoid the rate race, and I say good for them. But like, dang, just knowing that I won't get to that state of Financial Independence for another (hopefully just) 10 years really tires me out.  

2. As someone born in the early 90s, I'll be one of those that will have to cope with the increasingly detrimental effects of Climate Change, and to see [current leadership](https://youtu.be/cOmdkN6MOwU) from some of the biggest countries deny it outright or prioritize other goals, [even after seeing the effects firsthand](https://youtu.be/6BmbvTvFQ3g), keeps giving me existential dread. It's just one piece of bad news after the other, and I've been exposed to the point of apathy, not even depression. Well at least the coronavirus has reduced CO2 emissions from China for a bit.  
Sure, the announcement to fully migrate to EVs by 2040 is nice, and the rising popularity of Solar Panels is also cool, but it's still another 15-20 years of CO2 emissions - we need to go Carbon \*\*Negative\*\* by 2030 to avoid the point of no return. Also, the majority of our power mix is still Natural Gas, and of course that's better than burning Coal, but it contributes. It just sucks that Nuclear Energy isn't even a talking point here anymore, considering (at least from casual reading here on Reddit) the latest innovations in Nuclear Energy have Passive Nuclear Safety, can utilize Thorium as a fuel which is apparently 3 times more abundant than Uranium, Liquid Fluoride Coolant which is supposedly safer than traditional Water Cooling, Small Modular Reactors for decreased land usage, good energy to fuel wastage comparatively, etc... I always thought Singapore was a good use case for modern Nuclear Energy, considering no natural disasters and terrorism. Oh wells.",1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0
41,"“making it clear to stupid americans that trump had nothing to do with this virus”

this is the ego part. the fact that trump has to do something about a situation out of his control (the virus came into the usa and what people think happened). what he should be doing instead of focusing on what people think (ego), is focusing on how to further protect the country and listening to health professionals and other people who actually *know* what they’re talking about. he didn’t do this, and now the usa is months behind on gathering supplies for this pandemic. 

trump likes validation, and when he’s not the one giving helpful information, he feels insecure. An example of this is that random drug he proposed for helping treat covid-19 with no viable evidence whatsoever.

\~5 minute read:

So, a day or two ago I saw a post in one of the designated subreddits about how OP’s loved ones weren’t taking things seriously and laughing at them for being worried and wanting to be prepared. (Cant find it at the moment)

A lot of users chimed in confirming they were in a similar situation.  Immediately I    connected the dots and concluded that the “Facebook crowd”  was unusually not discussing this at the least! They lack peripheral vision when it comes to world events and have thus made the whole of Facebook a circle-jerk of people laughing out anyone brave enough to suggest that it’s better to be ridiculed for being prepared and not need the provisions than to later be ridiculed for not taking action should mass hysteria and human nature kick in.

Now, me and my family live in one of the safest places in the world to be during such an occasion, on an island in the Baltic sea, but JUST IN CASE SH1T HITS THE FAN me and my S/O have been making trips to the stores, and little by little gathering canned and dry goods, medical previsions, food for our pets and some cleaning and hygiene supplies. In just three days we’ve built up a stockpile that should last the three people living in the house, two cats, a large dog and 20 fish in the aquarium for at least 2 months.

Including a tank full of gas, this all cost us just around 400€. That’s for 3 people and a tiny zoo for 2 months. And in no way is this wasted money! IF it turns out the sky isn’t falling and the apocalypse gets canceled this time around (as it has been so many times before!) will we not be able to make use of the food? Will the gas in our car get rancid in 2 months? Will the pets suddenly not require feeding? NO! These things will come in handy even if everything turns out to be OK!

The first two days were quite calm, business as usual... nobody was buying canned goods, nobody was buying bottled water but today we got our first national scare, as two (TOTALLY HEALTHY) Chinese tourists in our capital were forced to go to the ER. At 1:30pm the local supermarket parking lots were full, all but two carts were in use and most of the cheaper canned goods were almost out of stock. Staff members were stocking rows of 5  liter water bottles in isles and everyone seemed on edge. A LOT of  local men work overseas in an already infected region and most of them visit home on weekends...

Now, all this being said, the statistics of this outbreak are still too fresh to make any  serious conclusions, in any case it would seem that for a previously healthy young(ish) person the likelihood of dying from nCoV2019 if infected is relatively low. But a lot of rumors and fearmongering is going on, people are starting to panic. And IF the statistics start showing exponential infection rates outside of China, mass hysteria and public unrest will follow! In conclusion, I am more concerned about the public reaction to nCoV2019 than the virus itself.

In light of all this I’ve created a Facebook page where I try and keep the common folk objectively updated on the situation and educate them on best practices to be ready to deal with this situation. The page is a work in progress and as I have nothing better to do, I’ll be working on it like a full time position.

I collect data from different groups and trusted news sources all over the internet, from Reddit and from global and national organizations and always link my sources. I avoid political and religious discussion and will not tolerate polarization or xenophobia in the comments.

**I  wholeheartedly hope this post/comment will not be deleted as my goal isn’t to steal anyone's thunder and in no way will I be profiting from this effort. My goal is to spread awareness and help people understand this situation for what it is and clear up the panic that has started to rear its ugly head among people who might not even know what Reddit is.**

Feel free to join and invite your friends and family as well. There is absolutely no need for   panic as that would only complicate the global efforts to contain this outbreak.

Don’t be scared, be prepared! :)

TL/DR:

1. People on Facebook being laughed at for showing concern.
2. 2.People seem unaware of the possible repercussions of nCoV2019 and the societal unrest that would ensue.

4. 4. Trying to provide information on best practices on self-quarantine and preparedness without being alarmist about it.
5. Please do not delete this, help me increase awareness instead!

44,"Essay I wrote because of boredom (Essentially a redux of letter from a Birmingham jail):

This election cycle, and every election cycle or politically charged time that has preceded it in our country, there has been an issue raised of ""civility."" Let me quickly state that I am all for civility if it is matched by both sides. This is an extremely rare phenomenon, but the liberals in this country would have you think it is always the case. When the antifascists (Antifa as they have become so fondly known as to erase the thing they are against from public perception) break windows, they are quickly dubbed ""domestic terrorists."" Black Lives Matter protestors are treated the same way. And these are the more radical examples in our country. A far cry from the direct action of these two groups is the campaign of Bernie Sanders. Yet even he and his supporters are accused of being ""uncivil"" for a lack of better criticism.

This is representative of a certain blindness or perhaps voluntary ignorance from liberals: ignorance of the violence embedded in the status quo. This violence is central to the American identity and has a strong monetary and social incentive to not be mentioned. Yet sometimes this violence becomes blatantly obvious, and if you are a keen observer it becomes dauntingly omnipresent as time passes. It is most visible in the stories of police brutality that we are exposed to every day. It is very obviously visible in every single ""foreign policy action"" the United States partakes in. Yet I'll try to provide some of the more ""invisible"" examples:

It is visible when President Obama has the audacity to fly out to Flint, Michigan, drink water for a photo op, and then leave the people to fall ill or pay thousands for the bare necessity that is water. It is visible when a few deaths from the novel Coronavirus that bring losses for the shareholders are publicized much more than the 20,000 daily (preventible) worldwide deaths from starvation will ever be. It is visible when the only black group in American history to ever arm themselves for self-defense based on their 2nd amendment rights are slaughtered by the FBI. It is visible when that same FBI injects minority neighborhoods with guns and drugs and then stars the ""war on drugs and crime"" which has become synonymous with the ""war on blacks and browns."" It is visible when the specter of slavery lives on through our prison system that incarcerates and exploits those same ""blacks and browns."" It is visible when even our ""Democratic"" leaders (e.g - Clintons) exploit those prisoners’ labor for their own gain, not unlike every capitalist in America. It is present when those same Democratic leaders and many more men in positions of socioeconomic power are able to get away with sexual harassment and assault. It is visible when both flavors of political party agree to send a $3 Billion stipend to Israel for the massacring of Palestinians. It is visible when companies like Nike present a theme of social justice and activism attached to their products that have been made through the exploitation of workers in the Asia-Pacific. It is present when every product we consume has in one way or another been touched by the exploitation of the third world that we perpetuate with our horrendously inflated military. It is visible when both parties reconcile their differences in order to continue funding said exploitation with &gt;$700 Billion a year.

As soon as this injustice is exposed, claims of being ""uncivil"" rear their ugly head. Bernie Sanders for decades now has been one of the few to expose and challenge the status quo, going as far as being arrested at civil rights rallies that would certainly be deemed “uncivil” today. The people he represents have been the most touched by this violence and to demand their civility is to completely and utterly silence their voice. It is to say ""Hush! Your cries for freedom are inconveniencing me."" It is apparent that those who bask in the all-forgiving aura of the status quo don't have to apologize for the injustices I mentioned and many more. To support this status quo and demand civility from the same people you meet with deadly force and systematic oppression on a daily basis is laughably hypocritical, yet through manufactured discourse and punditry it has been made almost instinctual for the privileged.

To conclude, I'll expand upon one of my favorite quotes of all time from Rosa Luxemburg. ""Those who do not move, do not notice their chains."" And those who are priveleged enough to not have to move too often complain about the noise created by those yearning to be free from their chains.",1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0
45,"I relate to this so heavily girl. I don’t have children, and I’m not at risk, but my parents are at risk. My boyfriend wouldn’t listen to a WORD about the virus, it would “stress him out” too much and he didn’t want the negative mindset. That drove me crazy. The reason why, was we were actually in the middle of moving to Seattle, when Seattle started getting their first couple cases. He was moving out there first and I was going to ship all of our belongings and move out at the end of the month (seems to be end of April... maybe even May now). I was in a hard position because I knew even in FEBRUARY, that by the time this hits the US we would probably be hit while he was Seattle and I was prepping to move. I told him every prediction I had, they all cane out true, but in the moment in February, and even beginning of March, he didn’t want to hear any of it. It didn’t hit him until the night before he got on his flight to Seattle, his parents called him and begged him not to go, and that the company he was moving there to work for (Amazon) had a positive covid19 developer in a building down the street from him. THEN it hit him like a ton of bricks. He still made the move, which he had to, and like I said i was mentally preparing since February, he’s been working from home since he’s arrived and we’re all good now, but I understand how hard this is. It’s like nothing can get the point across from it, this sounds fucked up but one of his CO WORKERS had to be infected for my boyfriend to wake up. And luckily, Seattle was the first to get hit so he woke up pretty early on compared to the rest of America.

I do want to give you some advice, I’m not sure all of it will be productive. I’m sure you’ve tried to press that your immunocompromised and he’s putting you at risk, but you might want to take it a step further and literally start fake coughing and be like “oh no this is a symptom of coronavirus... or at least the flu which is not good either” and just see what he says. I have a feeling it’s not going to his your husband either until it becomes real, and I don’t know where your from so I don’t know how real it is feeling in your community yet. I hope you can have a productive conversation, and I wish you the best in your marriage",0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0

Finally, as you correctly stated there are heavy quarantines enforced now.

***This virus was first reported in December and quarantines began around the 25th of January and for days the only containment effort was to take temperatures.***

47,"That’s awesome that you don’t have student debt. You’re already a step ahead. You also are being smart in picking up those certs. If you have any knack for programming or code languages, then you may also look into AI to hedge future bets. 

There was (is?) a significant demand for qualified developers. I’ve had a mostly terrible experience trying to find reliable developers around here. 

But we don’t yet know how much this pandemic will upend, so the business environment—with its needs and demands—may look different afterward. 

I have a feeling AI is a sure bet, because it is already starting to become proficient at jobs in media/marketing industries (i.e., website development, SEO, analytics, digital marketing, etc.). I have always resisted only doing web development to keep my skills diversified. Up here in the Colorado Rockies, there are very few people who specialize in the web development that I can offer. It’s lucrative, but what happens when something interrupts normalcy?

I don’t know you, obviously, but if AI doesn’t sound appealing, then I would suggest leaning into a creative talent that also produces good content. Generalized creativity is one of the last bastions of AI development, so if you have those such skills and talents, then there’s much you can do into the foreseeable future. 

For example, so many fucking people think they are graphic designers because they watched a couple of videos and have photoshop. And sadly, stupid clients hire them, which usually leads to disaster for idiot clients. 

When I offer my services, my education, and a robust creative portfolio, back me up. I tend to get higher quality clients who appreciate well-thought design and are willing to pay for it. 

So my point here is that if you have a creative talent or skill, you may want to invest some time and attention in becoming a master of it. Strong creative ability will help you stand out and can also insulate from AI encroachment...for now. It's also great for digital marketing and social media. ;)

Speaking of gyms, I got fucking ripped after the 2008 meltdown. I suddenly had time on my hands and extreme frustration, which I worked out. An older friend even told me that all dudes in their 20s need are food and a gym membership. If you can afford to hang onto a gym membership, it is so very much worth it. Sounds like you work at a gym? Awesome. 

I hope I don’t come across as some know it all. I’ve honestly been there, and since, I have counseled many of my students. I felt like I was dealt an unfair setback at 24, so I have taken a particular interest in trying to help others navigate these challenges. 

We are indeed in unprecedented, crazy times! I was low key freaking out in January when I first learned of the mysterious virus in Wuhan. I’m kind of a germaphobe at heart, so I pay special attention. 

I can’t yet say how my business is affected by this pandemic. I have a vast ($1b) client in the travel business who is pausing everything. I have another client in Aspen who thinks hot tea and sunshine will cure it, so she hasn’t reigned in spending. Not to mention there’s pretty widespread community transmission up there...yikes. 

If you have any interest, it sounds like you have some skills that I’m always looking to hire. I can’t make promises, but I am pretty sure I could at least throw a couple of projects your way for collaboration. I guess a lot depends on the apocalypse right now. :p

Throw me a PM if interested, and we can go from there! Otherwise, hang in there, because this too shall pass. :)",0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0
48,"&gt; # 12 people from 5 families among confirmed coronavirus cases in Singapore

&gt; SINGAPORE: At least 12 people from five families are among the confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus in Singapore so far.

&gt; Of these, six are linked to the country’s first cluster of local transmission announced by authorities earlier this week.

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; This includes the youngest patient in Singapore to date - a six-month-old baby boy who is the child of an infected couple.

&gt; Singapore had 28 confirmed cases as of Wednesday (Feb 5). Here’s what we know about these families:

&gt; 

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; FAMILY 1: CASES 1 AND 3

&gt; 

&gt; WHO: Father, 66, and son, 37, from Wuhan who arrived in Singapore with seven other travelling companions on Jan 20.

&gt; DETAILS: The 66-year-old – Singapore’s first case of the virus confirmed on Jan 23 – reported having a sore throat while on his flight to Singapore. He developed a fever the next day and began coughing.

&gt; After arriving in Singapore, the man checked in to Shangri-La’s Rasa Sentosa Resort and Spa. On Jan 22, he told hotel staff that he was unwell and was taken to the Singapore General Hospital (SGH), where he was isolated and diagnosed with pneumonia.

&gt; 

&gt; He was identified to the Ministry of Health (MOH) as a suspected case at 10pm and was tested positive the following day at 6pm. He remains in isolation at SGH.

&gt; 

&gt; The man’s son, who stayed with his father at the same hotel, became a confirmed case on Jan 24.

&gt; He is also currently in isolation at SGH.

&gt; Other family members travelling alongside the father and son – the wives of both men and the son’s two young children – have also come down with the infectious virus.

&gt; 

&gt; They were among Malaysia’s first few confirmed cases after they left Singapore for Johor Bahru at about 12pm on Jan 23, before the 66-year-old man was confirmed as infected with the virus later that day.

&gt; FAMILY 2: CASES 8 AND 9

&gt; WHO: A married couple – both 56-year-old Chinese nationals from Wuhan – who arrived in Singapore together on Jan 19.

&gt; DETAILS: Both cases did not show symptoms during their flight to Singapore. They only developed symptoms on Jan 24 and the couple took a taxi to Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) three days later.

&gt; They were classified as suspect cases and placed in isolation at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). Tests confirmed the couple as having the coronavirus on Jan 28 and Jan 29.

&gt; Before that, the couple had stayed with their family at their home at Lorong Lew Lian in Upper Serangoon.

&gt; FAMILY 3: CASES 13 AND 26

&gt; WHO: Mother, 73, and daughter, 42, from Wuhan who arrived in Singapore on Jan 21.

&gt; DETAILS: The 73-year-old woman was a close contact of the country’s second confirmed case – a 53-year-old woman from Wuhan who also arrived in Singapore on Jan 21.

&gt; 

&gt; The elderly woman was located on Jan 28 after MOH made multiple attempts to contact her, and she reported having developed symptoms on the same day.

&gt; She was then taken to NCID, where she was isolated. She was confirmed as the 13th infected case on Jan 30.

&gt; The woman had stayed at ParkRoyal Collection Pickering and Oasia Hotel Downtown, and visited Changi Airport and Jewel. She travelled by taxi and private transport.

&gt; Her daughter was confirmed as being infected with the coronavirus on Feb 4.

&gt; 

&gt; The 42-year-old had been taken by ambulance to NCID on the same day as her mother on Jan 28 after developing symptoms. She remains warded in an isolation room at NCID.

&gt; FAMILY 4: CASES 24 AND 25

&gt; WHO: A married couple with no recent travel history to China. The wife is a 32-year-old female Singapore resident and her husband, 40, is a Singapore citizen. They are among the locally-transmitted cases linked to a Chinese tour group that visited health products shop Yong Thai Hang in Cavan Road.

&gt; 

&gt; DETAILS: The 32-year-old works as a tour guide and has brought groups of tourists to Yong Thai Hang.

&gt; She had gone to NCID on Feb 3 with no symptoms – although she “subsequently informed NCID on (Tuesday) night that she had developed a fever on Jan 30”, according to MOH – and was confirmed positive on Feb 4 at about 2pm.

&gt; Prior to admission to NCID, the tour guide stayed at her home at Buangkok Green and worked at Jalan Besar. She had visited Hougang Polyclinic on Jan 30 and went to a supermarket near her home.

&gt; 

&gt; Her husband was also tested positive on Feb 4.

&gt; The 40-year-old man had developed a fever on Jan 24. He visited the same polyclinic as his wife on Jan 30, and self-presented at NCID four days later where he was immediately isolated.

&gt; Prior to being admitted, the man had stayed at home. He worked at Diamond Industries Jewellery Company at Harbour Drive, which the tour group from China had visited as well.

&gt; He had also visited Pasir Panjang Hawker Centre and travelled by public transport.

&gt; Both are currently warded in isolation rooms at NCID.

&gt; FAMILY 5: CASES 19, 21, 27 AND 28

&gt; WHO: A family of three – a 28-year-old female Singapore resident, a 45-year-old male Singapore citizen and a six-month-old baby boy – and their foreign domestic helper who are all linked to the first local transmission cluster. All four do not have recent travel history to China.

&gt; DETAILS: The 28-year-old – case 19 – works as a salesperson at Yong Thai Hang and reported having a sore throat and fever on Jan 29. She sought treatment at a GP clinic on the same day.

&gt; The following day, she went to TTSH’s emergency department and was discharged after a chest X-ray came back negative for pneumonia. She did not leave her home at Jalan Bukit Merah from Jan 31 to Feb 2.

&gt; On Feb 3, she was admitted to SGH and tested positive for the novel coronavirus on the same day. She is currently warded in an isolation room at SGH.

&gt; Her husband and son – cases 27 and 28 – were announced to have come down with the novel coronavirus on Feb 5.

&gt; The former is currently warded at the NCID, while their six-month-old baby boy is now in an isolation room at KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital. Both are in stable condition.

&gt; In response to media queries, MOH said the six-month-old baby boy was not in any infant care facility prior to hospital admission, and was cared for at home.

&gt; 

&gt; The family’s foreign domestic helper has also come down with the virus.

&gt; The 44-year-old Indonesian woman – case 21 – reported onset of symptoms on Feb 2 and did not leave her place of residence at Jalan Bukit Merah. She was admitted to SGH on Feb 3 and tested positive the next day.

&gt; Separately, a colleague of the 28-year-old salesperson is also warded with the virus at NCID.

&gt; MORE ABOUT TOUR GROUP THAT VISITED YONG THAI HANG

&gt; 

&gt; There are now seven people infected by the coronavirus in Singapore's first cluster of local transmission, which is linked to a Chinese tour group that visited Yong Thai Hang in Cavan Road last month.

&gt; The shop is a complementary health products shop that primarily serves Chinese tourists, MOH said.

&gt; The tour group of 20 had arrived in Singapore on Jan 22 and left for Malaysia on Jan 24. They later came back to Singapore at about 3am on Jan 27, before leaving the country at about 6am.

&gt; Two among the tour group have tested positive for the virus, MOH said on Feb 5 citing confirmation from Chinese health authorities.

&gt; Besides Yong Thai Hang and Diamond Industries Jewellery Company, the group also visited various spots in Singapore, such as Meeting You Restaurant in Hamilton Road, Royal Dragon Restaurant in Havelock Road, T Galleria by DFS in Scotts Road and the D’Resort @ Downtown East in Pasir Ris.

&gt; 

&gt; MOH said it has been almost 14 days since the tourists visited these places. It has reached out to 142 contacts, of which “all but one are well”.

&gt; 

&gt; “The person has been isolated as a suspect case and test results are pending,” authorities said.

&gt; Contact tracing was also conducted for the crew and passengers of the departing flight on Jan 27. Five are in Singapore and have been quarantined.

One experience involved 3 of my closest friends, about 2 grams of magic mushrooms each and our favorite music in our headphones. At one moment through our trip, I picked my head up to look at the nights sky to revel in its wonder and mystery and was greeted by the most amazing spectacle of natural fireworks. We all had to phone other local friends (who were sober) to clarify that this is indeed happening and that we weren't just loosing our sanity.

51,"Edit: I am not sure what happened to the thread as it got swapped from pinned to non-pinned and I can't see it on the main page so I'll try to clean this comment up a bit and make it a text post.. dunno what happened to the thread..?

No comments yet? Well, I guess I can start us off on a hopefully-productive-note. Edit: Oh three comments by the time i finished typing. Mild credentials: I have some expertise with logistics and previously tried to calm people down during the Ebola scare in 2014, as well as some minor research in bacteria and the like. I also live in one of the [dense red zones in California, close to San Fran.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html) 

California's planning is.. messy. It's difficult to tell what city or county has what plans or programs in motion, and a lot is done without communication between branches. It can be hard for the average citizen to simply become aware actions are being taken and what their role in it can or should be. The following suggestion may be entirely redundant to you if you live in an area where the issue is covered already or redundant, but for those not so fortunate: 

I would propose a reminder that the people maintaining electricity, water, internet connections, etc. have families too, and cannot simply ""not go to work."" Our infrastructure goes down and it's back to the dark ages. In times of emergency that causes shortage of goods or the halting of supply or manufacture of them, the ""infrastructure service"" should receive a stipend of non-cash material, based off the triggered shortages, and role - such as expanded sanitation and protection provided for people expected to interact with others or the items of others.

In summary: The garbage-men, grocers, and related handlers should be given sanitation materials. People maintaining water plants, nurses, doctors and the like should receive a stipend of canned foods and consumables based on family size (as a quick slapdash temporary solution if no more accurate metric is available, *I am not implying that two people with different diet needs can be given the same items ofc*). I am *NOT* proposing cash aid. I am merely proposing that, we have the luxury of being able to communicate and plan and discuss and debate, using an internet connection or a phone, and this is a *luxury* that is provided by someone's labor. Measures should be taken to ensure that labor source is not stuck fearing for their family's future or savings because some scalper is charging $20 for a toilet roll. 

How such a program could be arranged, especially given the current shortages, I suppose that's up to a lot of debate and discourse and the answer may vary from city to town to county, and vary based on laws (and I am no lawyer). Ideally, I would suggest that a local governing body, if the central governing body is proving inactive, should utilize tax money (or donations if so fortunate) to create a ""rainy day bank"" - of long-shelf-life canned goods and similar materials, based off the average population's consumption of such goods over the course of a month. Should the items begin reaching the extent of their shelf life (however long it may be), they are then replaced by a newer item, and the previous one nearing the end of its cycle placed into circulation for immediate use, sold as a local-government-surplus in order to recoup expenses and lessen tax burden. Such a measure should be applied for any risk of scarcity, and this protection would not be limited to simply an outbreak or quarantine, but other more common and more probable emergencies such as earthquake.

Ideally cooperation with the Federal government would be possible and this could include such things as military MRE's and other materiel, which I believe has justified use in times such as this. 

How exactly such a stipend / bank / rainy-day-fund / etc. etc. like the above could work, how to raise funds for it, how to recoup losses on those funds to lessen the expense, etc. in any specific individual area, that part I cannot answer as I do not have the requisite legal skills. It may not even be acceptable for a governing body to use tax-purchased items to lower expenses (via selling items) in some areas, and I am not familiar enough with the various local city rules, regulations, laws... I have been contemplating calling my local mayor and discussing the above system and ask if we could get some mil surplus or some other sort of import from other areas of the country, etc, etc,. and trying to make this above idea that I came up with over the past few hours a reality.. I'd hoped to provide a more useful suggestion than ""write/call your local official"" or ""talk to a lawyer"" which may be nebulous and unhelpful., and the answer may be different for others... though hopefully the idea itself, the concept, can be adapted by you, the reader - to fit to your situation and needs and capabilities. Maybe it can be done in one area via local gov, maybe in another it has to be done independently by a few people getting together and planning with out-of-state associates to do it privately, I cannot answer which will be best for which region. 

...though on the other hand I did make this after being awake through all of last night and havn't been asleep since earlier yesterday-morning, so perhaps sleep deprivation blinds me to some obvious flaw in my suggestion (aside from the shortage of items to put in the bank as an immediate solution, since that's what the whole importing or cooperation with mil/central was about). I apologize if my post is overly-verbose; I passed 30 hrs awake a while ago and I am aware it dulls my mind. 

A bit too tired to type out full list of economic ideas on raising funds for / obtaining item imports for, said bank/rainy-day-materials/materiel. Shorthand suggestions of immediate function: 

Wash your hands thoroughly. Consider use of things such as eye protection, people rub their eyes habitually and you do not know what kind of silly mistake you'll make due to sheer force of habit. Humans are imperfect creatures of habit. You may consciously think ""oh, I'll wash my hands"" and then suddenly you're rubbing your eyes or scratching your nose. Put a redundancy in place to cover for your habits that may normally be beneficial but in this case may harm you. Maybe that's disposable gloves, maybe that's sunglasses on a cloudy day, I don't know. I just know that humans that are hungry, thirsty, horny, sleepy, etc. are prone to massive lapses in judgement. 

Be aware of human limitations. Don't devolve into a beast. Being able to think, to overcome our own flaws, to not be slaves to our basest instincts, is what makes us who and what we are.",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0
52,"Yes the safe bet because basically everything in your comment is incorrect. Not going to bother articulating why each of your points in incorrect, because arguing against people who are obviously incredibly biased usually ends up being a circle jerk. Let's go through your comment. 

&gt;Trump has not implemented any policies that had a significant impact on the economy.

Pure conjecture, you aren't providing any evidence. 

&gt;All he has managed is to not fuck up growth that was already happening. 

Again where is the evidence for this? 

&gt;And he comes with the added nuttiness of behavior like this, and Ukraine, and Soleimani, and Syria. Everything he does is a knee-jerk decision that he and his administration have to scramble to rationalize later.

You are way too emotional In your argument. Despite the ""nuttiness"" of those situations, nothing ""nutty"" has come out of it. 

Now let me explain why Trump is a safe bet. First off, **im not a Trump supporter**, I am simply explaining the situation. His deregulation of the economy has resulted in economic growth, despite what you said. His trade wars have not damaged the economy anywhere near as much as what was predicted by the liberal media, and they actually seem to be working. I mean just look at the position China is in, there is not a better time to leverage China for better trade policies than now, they are dealing with HK, Uygher camps, and the coronavirus it's a perfect time to pressure them into trade reforms. 

Despite his aggression towards Iran, we aren't (and not going to be) at war with Iran, or involved in any new major conflicts overseas. 

He is the safe bet. Now I'll explain why Bernie is not a safe pick. Despite people saying his policies are not radical, they indeed are. Completely reforming healthcare, immigration, climate, and education is indeed radical. The majority of these reforms will result in increased taxation across the board, for policies that may not even be effective. 


I'm not arguing that Bernie's policies are bad (except his immigration policies, which I will certainly say are terrible) I actually agree with them. My point is that they represent risk to the voters, and that risk is for good reason. Our federal government has a reputation for doing a terrible job, so its not out of the question to think they will do a terrible job implementing policies such as universal healthcare.",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
53,"Nobel laureate Michael Levitt, an American-British-Israeli biophysicist who teaches structural biology at Stanford University and spends much of his time in Tel Aviv, unexpectedly became a household name in China, offering the public reassurance during the peak of the country’s coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak. Levitt did not discover a treatment or a cure, just did what he does best: crunched the numbers. The statistics led him to the conclusion that, contrary to the grim forecasts being branded about, the spread of the virus will come to a halt.
The calming messages Levitt sent to his friends in China were translated into Chinese and passed from person to person, making him a popular subject for interviews in the Asian nation. His forecasts turned out to be correct: the number of new cases reported each day started to fall as of February 7. A week later, the mortality rate started falling as well.


He might not be an expert in epidemiology, but Levitt understands calculations and statistics, he told Calcalist in a phone interview earlier this week.

The interview was initially scheduled to be held at the fashionable Sarona complex in Tel Aviv, where Levitt currently resides. But after he caught a cold—”not corona,” he jokingly remarked—the interview was rescheduled to be held over the phone. Even though he believes the pandemic will run its course, Levitt emphasises his support of all the safety measures currently being taken and the need to adhere to them.

Levitt received his Nobel prize for chemistry in 2013 for ""the development of multiscale models for complex chemical systems."" He did not in any way intend to be a prophet foretelling the end of a plague; it happened by accident. His wife Shoshan Brosh is a researcher of Chinese art and a curator for local photographers, meaning the couple splits their time between the U.S., Israel, and China.

When the pandemic broke out, Brosh wrote to friends in China to support them. “When they answered us, describing how complicated their situation was, I decided to take a deeper look at the numbers in the hope of reaching some conclusion,” Levitt explained. “The rate of infection of the virus in the Hubei province increased by 30% each day—that is a scary statistic. I am not an influenza expert but I can analyze numbers and that is exponential growth.” At this rate, the entire world should have been infected within 90 days, he said.

But then, the trend changed. When Levitt started analyzing the data on February 1, Hubei had 1,800 new cases each day and within six days this number reached 4,700, he said. “And then, on February 7, the number of new infections started to drop linearly and did not stop. A week later, the same happened with the number of the deaths. This dramatic change in the curve marked the median point and enabled better prediction of when the pandemic will end. Based on that, I concluded that the situation in all of China will improve within two weeks. And, indeed, now there are very few new infection cases.”

Levitt compared the situation to bank interest—if on the first day a person receives an interest rate of 30% on their savings, the next day of 29%, and so forth, “you understand that eventually, you will not earn very much.”

The messages his friends translated quickly made waves in China and people wanting to make sure he did indeed write the information attributed to him started contacting Levitt. “That is how I knew I needed to continue,” he said. “I could have said, yes, that’s what I said,’ and left it at that.”",0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0
54,"Just as a personal anecdote, here’s a timeline of each member of my aunt’s family in Wuhan (whom I suspect might’ve all gotten infected at some point).

Father-In-Law: Showed severe symptoms in late January. Hospitals were overrun by then and he couldn’t get himself checked. Stayed at home with his wife (Mother-In-Law), and because they are both elders, my aunt, her husband, her sister-in-law and her brother-in-law took turns to bring them food and they ate together. He was finally able to be checked 10 days after showing symptoms and the test came back negative.

Mother-In-Law: Never shown symptoms, never checked. Slept in the same bed and ate on the same table as father-in-law throughout.

Aunt: Showed slight symptoms (no fever, only cough) that persisted for 2 weeks days after eating together with father-in-law. Initially avoided getting checked, but finally had to get one after her husband tested positive and tested positive herself.

Husband: Showed slight symptoms (persistent low fever of 37.5 degrees Celsius) for 2-and-a-half weeks. Tested positive. Sent into emergency after complications.

Sister-In-Law: No symptoms, tested negative

Niece: No symptoms, tested negative

I think it’s quite clear that the father-in-law was in fact carrying COVID-19 but he was missed due to Wuhan’s medical system being overrun. Given the proximity of each of these people to those who have tested positive, I’m pretty sure all of them do in fact carry the virus. However only 3/7 were confirmed cases. 6/7 of them did tests. Extrapolate this and account for those who never got around to testing because no one in that cluster showed symptoms, I’d think that the numbers modelled are closer to the true story too.

That being said, given that outside of Wuhan and Hubei, the medical systems held up just fine and the death rates are close to what is observed in South Korea, it’s also a good guess that community spread was limited in China outside Wuhan.",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

56,"This is one of series of news articles that I'm surprised is not widely circulated because of the vital importances and implications

 [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/20/eradicated-coronavirus-mass-testing-covid-19-italy-vo](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/20/eradicated-coronavirus-mass-testing-covid-19-italy-vo) 

Key highlights ... Northern Town of Italy with 3000 Pop. Real life experiment conducted to test every single person. 3% (89) tested positive. Worryingly, ""asymptomatic or quasi-symptomatic subjects represent a good 70% of all virus-infected people"". Full and voluntary self quarantine (not just self isolation). 9 days later 6 tested positive and trending towards zero. Zero Community Transmission. Clinical mortality is substantially lower than real life mortality.

The researchers conclusion is ....

"" In the absence of specific therapies or a vaccine, quarantine, distancing and identification of asymptomatic carriers remain the only real measures to control this epidemic.  ""

At first you may think this is impossible to be applicable to major cities or the horse has bolted, myself and even the article acknowledges the former. However here's what I think are some obvious and less obvious takeaway. 

(1) This is **measurable** proof of asymptomatic or quasi-symptomatic positives. You can tell a less informed, irresponsible person who has close contact with and cares about a person of high risk of COVID19 mortality the risk the danger they pose even if initially they don't have symptoms.

(2) When I scenario build out how COVID19 will play out in future, I cannot escape the conclusion that closed countries, closed internal borders and quarantines will persist for the next 12-18 months regardless of what all governments are telling us now. COVID19 will leak through the weakest link in any quarantine (think Sub Sahara Africa) and it is impossible for COVID19 to be eradicated short of something akin to a worldwide roll out of a working vaccine like the smallpox vaccine. So the only choice to minimise the impact is actually to ramp up testing kits, aside from ventilators and personal protection equipment (PPE). 

(3) Expanding on testing. Some governments are already giving up on increasing testing, however that's an incorrect strategy. One effective strategy is to repurpose manufacturing capacity (with the vast numbers of coming jobless) to ramp up delivery and testing analysis. Testing methods and technologies will continue to improve. Human desperation and ingenuity will drive this. South Korea tests 20,000 a day already, with improved techniques, additional resources and a war footing - a tenfold increased in capacity is entirely possible and then it takes 275 days to test everyone in South Korea 55 Mil / 200k tests. You kill a giant in many, many small steps - and you get your neighbours to help out. (we sold 1.56 billion smartphones in 2018 - mass production is more powerful than most people understand)

(4) Once testing capacity exponentially increase, governments should test all health workers, and all arrivals first regardless of symptoms, then break the country into smaller components be it shire, council, province, town, suburb etc, test everyone there and slowly identify green zones, keeping strong quarantines to protect these greenzones from outside visitors while letting life and the economy recover in these green zones. To illustrate, Parts of China, Taiwan are effectively green zones already.

The population will baulk at the more and more imposition of freedoms, but think about historical war situations and even the day by day changing of your own mindset through COVID19, if explained well the population will do the right thing in time when there's an existential threat (not to humanity but definitely to our current way of life that's underpined by the economy). Can we really afford a big chunk of our population to not work for 12-18 months? notwithstanding the direct and indirect terrible human toll.

In short, don't give up on a strategy to ramp up testing a hundred fold or more. If may seem insurmountable and impossible today, I point you towards historical human mobilisation from the World War 2 efforts and the building of Pyramids...

57,"What they're talking about is [antibody dependent enhancement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody-dependent_enhancement).

If, like Dengue fever, COVID-19 has multiple serotypes, it's possible that getting infected a second time could be worse.  In simple terms, let's say your body gets into a fight with some kid.  After a while, your body realizes that this kid always leads by kicking with his left foot.  You win the battle.  Oh, the kid is back for another round - except it's not him, it's his look-alike twin brother.  You put everything into bracing for the kick from the left foot, and he outright punches you in the face.

Bear in mind that there is no evidence that there are multiple serotypes of COVID-19.  But then again, there's no evidence that there isn't either.  All I'm saying is that this is possible.

This would be the ultimate in bad news if it's true.  But it also helps to explain the difference in mortality in Hubei vs. the rest of China (they've had the time to reinfect, whereas the rest of China is still on round 1), and possibly why this darn virus is so hard to detect.

59,"&gt; You are not suppose to wear a mask unless you are sick.

On the contrary, literally ALL of the available data from real studies shows that masks (including surgical masks and *even home-made masks*) help to reduce the chance of the wearer being infected by viruses.

[National Institutes of Health](http://archive.is/5Vm12) - Home-made cloth masks reduce permeation even of tiny 0.02 µm–1 µm particles by 50%, with surgical masks reducing permeation by 75% even during real-world activities.  Considering that droplet transmission viruses (like the one causing COVID19) often require larger droplets than that, these masks could be even more effective against this particular virus.

Quote:
&gt; Any type of general mask use is likely to decrease viral exposure and infection risk on a population level, in spite of imperfect fit and imperfect adherence, personal respirators providing most protection.

---

[International Journal of Infectious Diseases](http://archive.is/1Mwcb) - This one shows surgical masks preventing the wearer from being infected when living with someone who has the flu.

Quote:
&gt; We found compliance to be low, but compliance is affected by perception of risk. In a pandemic, we would expect compliance to improve. In compliant users, masks were highly efficacious.

---

[Journal of the American Medical Association](http://archive.is/cvUQ7) - This study of 446 nurses in Ontario hospitals showed that n95 masks and surgical masks offered similar protection from viral infection for the wearer.

Quote:
&gt; Our data show that the incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza was similar in nurses wearing the surgical mask and those wearing the N95 respirator. Surgical masks had an estimated efficacy within 1% of N95 respirators.

---

[National Institutes of Health](http://archive.is/GMOaG) - Surgical masks offer almost as effective filtration efficiency against simulated particles as n95 masks.

Quote:
&gt; The in-vivo filtration tests illustrated that N95 respirators filtered out 97% of potassium chloride (KCl) solution, while surgical masks filtered out 95% of KCl solution.

---

And for the coup de grâce, here's one published in [Emerging Infectious Diseases](http://archive.is/spCh6) (the journal of the CDC) with a juicy quote:

&gt; We present the results of a prospective clinical trial of face mask use conducted in response to an urgent need to clarify the clinical benefit of using masks. The key findings are that &lt;50% of participants were adherent with mask use and that the intention-to-treat analysis showed no difference between arms. Although our study suggests that community use of face masks is unlikely to be an effective control policy for seasonal respiratory diseases, **adherent mask users had a significant reduction in the risk for clinical infection**. Another recent study that examined the use of surgical masks and handwashing for the prevention of influenza transmission also found no significant difference between the intervention arms (12).

&gt; Our study found that only 21% of household contacts in the face mask arms reported wearing the mask often or always during the follow-up period. Adherence with treatments and preventive measures is well known to vary depending on perception of risk (27) and would be expected to increase during an influenza pandemic. During the height of the SARS epidemic of April and May 2003 in Hong Kong, adherence to infection control measures was high; 76% of the population wore a face mask, 65% washed their hands after relevant contact, and 78% covered their mouths when sneezing or coughing (28). In addition, adherence may vary depending on cultural context; Asian cultures are more accepting of mask use (29). Therefore, although we found that distributing masks during seasonal winter influenza outbreaks is an ineffective control measure characterized by low adherence, **results indicate the potential efficacy of masks in contexts where a larger adherence may be expected, such as during a severe influenza pandemic or other emerging infection.**

---

But even if you choose to ignore the science, and even the CDC's own study... do you think that there wasn't a single cough from someone in the hours they waited in line in OP's picture?  If everyone were wearing a mask, then, at the *very least*, the one person who is sick but doesn't realize it would be less likely to infect others.",0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
60,"Without quarantine measures, the number of daily deaths from the virus seems to spread exponentially for 25 days, remain constant for 10 days and go down exponentially for another 25 days, when the number of deaths ends. This generates a 60-day cycle where 0.1% to 0.2% of the entire population would die from the disease.

The more efficient the quarantine measures, the lower the infection rate per day, which varies from 30% to 60% of increase in the number of infected per day. The sooner the chart reaches the plateau, the less dead in the 60-day cycle.

The numbers of infected people are 5 to 30 times higher than the official numbers, which shows a very high false mortality, above 1%, reaching 8%.

China, Korea and Taiwan quickly took very efficient measures and in 60 days of cycle they already got rid of the virus (China) or they will get rid if they keep the measures efficiently (Korea and Taiwan).

In Italy the measures came late and as the quarantine takes 10 days to have an effect on the number of infected and dead, it will have a high number of deaths, I estimate that about 10 thousand dead by 5/1.

In Brazil, no total quarantine measures have been taken, which should lead to 160,000 deaths if this continues. If a strict quarantine is declared and effectively carried out on 03/26 (tenth day after the first death) 37 thousand Brazilians should die by covid-19.

61,"Actually, we are now past the containment stage. So, it is no longer as important to test. During the containment stage, identifying infected cases, isolating them and attempting to figure out who they came into contact with was important. Now, the cat is out of the bag. We know the virus is spreading everywhere, so finding all of the cases isn't as important.

We're at the delay stage. We need to slow the virus down. That means if you are actively sick, you isolate yourself as much as possible. Even if you aren't actively sick, the less everyone moves around in their community the better. The goal now is to slow the virus down as much as possible to increase the chance that local hospitals can deal with those who need critical care. The more we slow it down, the more people will survive.

So, at this time, you only need a test if you are very ill and likely to need hospitalization. If you are mild to moderately ill, you can take care of yourself at home. Just like when you have the flu. Going to see a doctor in order to get tested is just going to expose more people to germs, potentially expose you to secondary infection, and tie up valuable resources. All medical staff now need to focus on critical cases.

The important thing for people to remember is there *are no medications* for the coronavirus. Even if you insist on seeing a doctor and get tested, you are not going to receive a prescription. They are just going to be able to tell you, ""yeah, you have it"". Their advice to you is going to be the same as with any viral infection: get plenty of rest, get plenty of fluids, eat if your body wants to eat, don't worry about eating if you don't feel like it.

Some of the following advice is things I've learned since the virus began or things I've known for awhile. So, if it's something I've known for awhile, I'm going to put (me) to identify that thing. I'm not an expert or anything.

You shouldn't take a fever reducer such as tylenol, aspirin or ibuprofen when you have the virus. Yes, it will reduce your fever, your aches and pains, and generally make you feel better. However, your immune system works much better when your body temperature is high. You will have a greater chance of fighting off the virus if you leave your fever alone and allow your body to do its job.   (me) I haven't heard any actually numbers for this, but I plan to leave my fever alone unless it reaches 103 degrees.

Medications like Mucinex aren't supposed to be effective for the virus. (me) But I haven't heard that it will do any harm to take an expectorant. I am \*assuming\* that taking some Mucinex to mentally feel as if I've done something to help myself will be okay. I would be careful about taking cough suppressants. Mucinex is an expectorant, it's supposed to thin mucus in your respiratory tract so that your body can cough them out. However, cough suppressants that make you stop coughing are supposed to increase your chances of developing pneumonia. This is \*just\* general stuff that I learned years ago. I'm not sure if it applies to the coronavirus.",0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0

&gt;Coronavirus: England only has 15 beds for worst respiratory cases
NHS says system will struggle if more than 28 patients need artificial lung treatment

&gt;England only has 15 available beds for adults to treat the most severe respiratory failure and will struggle to cope if there are more than 28 patients who need them if the number of coronavirus cases rises, according to the government and NHS documents.

&gt;Ministers have revealed in parliamentary answers that there are 15 available beds for adult extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) treatment at five centres across England. The government said this could be increased in an emergency. There were 30 such beds in total available during the 2018-19 winter flu season

&gt; Ministers also revealed that since the beginning of February there have been eight “high-consequence infectious disease” beds and around 500 “infectious disease” beds.

&gt;For most of last week, there were roughly 3,700 adult critical care beds in England, of which about 80% were occupied. This left 670 such beds free at the peak of occupancy.

&gt;Jon Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, questioned the readiness of the NHS to deal with a sharp escalation of coronavirus cases following years of cutbacks.

&gt;“After years of Tory austerity, we know we’ve lost well over 15,000 beds since 2010,” he said. “We know that last week critical care bed occupancy was running at over 80%.

SINGAPORE - There is no robust proof that the coronavirus can be  spread by someone with no symptoms of the disease, said Dr Shawn Vasoo,  clinical director of the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).

A letter in the New England Journal Of Medicine on Jan 30 saying that  this has happened has since been proven to be wrong, he said.

The letter by doctors from the University Hospital of Ludwig  Maximilian University of Munich had said a German businessman had caught  the infection from a Chinese woman whom he had met when she was in  Germany.

They said the woman had only become sick on her flight home to Shanghai and was later found to be infected with the coronavirus.

This had led to fears of asymptomatic transmission, which would be difficult to stem.

However, it later transpired that the doctors had not spoken to the  woman at all, and had merely taken the German man's word that she had  been well when they had met.

However, when she was interviewed in Shanghai, she disclosed that she had been sick while in Germany.

Since then, there have been other anecdotal reports, including a  letter in the Journal Of The American Medical Association on Feb 21 by a  team of doctors from China.

They described five members of a family in Anyang, China, who were [infected by another family member who was ""presumed"" asymptomatic](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/wuhan-woman-with-no-symptoms-infects-five-relatives-with-coronavirus-study). She had been in Wuhan, where the family and the doctors believe she was infected by the virus.

However, the doctors, who were more cautious in claiming it as an  asymptomatic transmission, said: ""The sequence of events suggests that  the coronavirus may have been transmitted by the asymptomatic carrier.""

Dr Vasoo said this report is limited in that is not so clear about  whether the patient in question had infected the others, or was infected  by them. It was presumed that she was the source of the infection  simply because she had been to Wuhan, [the outbreak's epicentre](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/coronavirus-locked-in-wuhan-residents-adapt-to-find-food).

He added that in this case: ""Environmental contamination or exposure to other infected persons cannot be excluded.""

Some who are said to be ""asymptomatic"" may actually have ""mild symptoms that people do not make much of"", he said.

– Second the casualty: most deadly damages one at short amount of time, more than all the Cancer, HIV combine many times.

By Vivian Wang and Makiko Inoue
Published March 4, 2020
Updated March 5, 2020, 12:16 a.m. ET

HONG KONG — The coronavirus epidemic reached deeper into daily life across the world on Wednesday, with a sweeping shutdown of all schools in Italy and warnings of school closures in the United States, intensifying the educational upheaval of nearly 300 million students globally.

Only a few weeks ago, China, where the outbreak began, was the only country to suspend classes. But the virus has spread so quickly that by Wednesday, 22 countries on three continents had announced school closures of varying degrees, leading the United Nations to warn that “the global scale and speed of the current educational disruption is unparalleled.”  

Students are now out of school in South Korea, Iran, Japan, France, Pakistan and elsewhere — some for only a few days, others for weeks on end. In Italy, suffering one of the deadliest outbreaks outside China, officials said Wednesday that they would extend school closures beyond the north, where the government has imposed a lockdown on several towns, to the entire nation. All schools and universities will remain closed until March 15, officials said.
VIRUS UPDATESRead the latest news and analysis about the coronavirus outbreak here.
On the West Coast of the United States, the region with the most American infections so far, Los Angeles declared a state of emergency on Wednesday, advising parents to steel themselves for school closures in the nation’s second-largest public school district. Washington State, which has reported at least 10 deaths from the outbreak, has closed some schools, while on the other side of the country in New York, newly diagnosed cases have led to the closure of several schools as well.  
The speed and scale of the educational tumult — which now affects 290.5 million students worldwide, the United Nations says — has little parallel in modern history, educators and economists contend. Schools provide structure and support for families, communities and entire economies. The effect of closing them for days, weeks and sometimes even months could have untold repercussions for children and societies at large.

“They’re always saying, ‘When can we go out to play? When can we go to school?’” said Gao Mengxian, a security guard in Hong Kong whose two daughters have been stuck at home because school has been suspended since January.

In some countries, older students have missed crucial study sessions for college admissions exams, while younger ones have risked falling behind in reading and math. Parents have lost wages, tried to work at home or scrambled to find child care. Some have moved  children to new schools in areas unaffected by the coronavirus, and lost milestones like graduation ceremonies or last days of school.

“I don’t have data to offer, but can’t think of any instances in modern times where advanced economies shut down schools nationally for prolonged periods of time,” said Jacob Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.

In Hong Kong, families like Ms. Gao’s have struggled to maintain some semblance of normalcy.

Ms. Gao, 48, stopped working to watch her daughters and started scrimping on household expenses. She ventures outside just once a week and spends the most time helping her girls, 10 and 8, with online classes, fumbling through technology that leaves her confused and her daughters frustrated.

Governments are trying to help. Japan is offering subsidies to help companies offset the cost of parents’ taking time off. France has promised 14 days of paid sick leave to parents of children who must self-isolate, if they have no choice but to watch their children.

But the burdens are widespread, touching corners of society seemingly unconnected to education. In Japan, schools have canceled bulk food deliveries for lunches they will no longer serve, hurting farmers and suppliers. In Hong Kong, an army of domestic helpers has been left unemployed after wealthy families enrolled their children in schools overseas.


Julia Bossard, a 39-year-old mother of two in France, said she had been forced to rethink her entire routine since her older son’s school was closed for two weeks for disinfection. Her days now consist of helping her children with homework and scouring supermarkets for fast-disappearing pasta, rice and canned food. “We had to reorganize ourselves,” she said.


Online and Alone
School and government officials have sought to keep children learning — and occupied — at home. The Italian government created a web page to give teachers access to videoconference tools and ready-made lesson plans. Mongolian television stations are airing classes. Iran’s government has made all children’s internet content free.
Students even take online physical education: At least one school in Hong Kong requires students — in gym uniform — to follow along as an instructor demonstrates push-ups onscreen. Each student’s webcam provides proof.

The offline reality, though, is challenging.  Technological hurdles and unavoidable distractions  pop up when children and teenagers are left to their own devices — literally.

Thira Pang, a 17-year-old high school student in Hong Kong, has been repeatedly late for class because her internet connection is slow. She now logs on 15 minutes early.

“It’s just a bit of luck to see whether you can get in,” she said.

The new classroom at home poses greater problems for younger students, and their older caregivers. Ruby Tan, a teacher in Chongqing, a city in southwestern China that suspended school last month, said many grandparents were helping with child care so that the parents can go to work. But the grandparents do not always know the technology.

“They don’t have any way of supervising the children’s learning, and instead let them develop bad habits of not being able to focus during study time,” Ms. Tan said.

Some interruptions are unavoidable. Posts on Chinese social media show teachers and students climbing onto rooftops or hovering outside neighbors’ homes in search of a stronger internet signal. One family in Inner Mongolia packed up its yurt and migrated elsewhere in the grasslands for a better web connection, a Chinese magazine reported.

The closings have also altered the normal milestones of education. In Japan, the school year typically ends in March. Many schools are now restricting the ceremonies to teachers and students.
When Satoko Morita’s son graduated from high school in Akita Prefecture, in northern Japan, on March 1, she was not there. It will be the same for her daughter’s ceremony at elementary school.

“My daughter asked me, ‘What’s the point of attending and delivering speeches in the ceremony without parents?’” she said.

For Chloe Lau, a Hong Kong student, the end of her high school education came abruptly. Her last day was supposed to be April 2, but schools in Hong Kong will not resume until at least April 20.


A Burden on Women
With the closings, families must rethink how they support themselves and split household responsibilities. The burden has fallen particularly hard on women, who across the world are still largely responsible for child care.

Babysitters are in short supply or leery of taking children from hard-hit regions.

The 11-year-old son of Lee Seong-yeon, a health information manager at a hospital in Seoul, South Korea, has been out of class since the government suspended schools nationwide on Monday. South Korea has the highest number of coronavirus cases outside China.

Working from home was never an option for Ms. Lee: She and her husband, also a hospital employee, have more work duties than ever. So Ms. Lee’s son spends each weekday alone, eating lunchboxes of sausage and kimchi fried rice premade by Ms. Lee.
“I think I would have quit my job if my son were younger, because I wouldn’t have been able to leave him alone at home,” Ms. Lee said.

Still, she feels her career will suffer. “I try to get off work at 6 p.m. sharp, even when others at the office are still at their desks, and I run home to my son and make him dinner,” she said. “So I know there is no way I am ever going to be acknowledged for my career at work.”

For mothers with few safety nets, options are even more limited.

In Athens,  Anastasia Moschos said she had been lucky. When her 6-year-old son’s school was closed for a week, Ms. Moschos, 47, an insurance broker, left her son with her father, who was visiting. But if the schools stay closed, she may have to scramble for help.

“The assumption is that everyone has someone to assist,” she said. “That’s not the case with me. I’m a single mother, and I don’t have help at home.”

Even mothers able to leave affected areas have trouble finding child care. Cristina Tagliabue, a communications entrepreneur from Milan, the center of Italy’s outbreak, recently moved with her 2-year-old son to her second home in Rome. But no day care facility would  accept her son because other parents did not want anyone from Milan near their children, Ms. Tagliabue said.

The closings in Italy — which include day care in addition to schools and universities — are likely to create problems for parents nationwide.

Ms. Tagliabue has turned down several job proposals, she said, since she is unable to work at home without a babysitter for her young child.
“It’s right to close schools, but that has a cost,” she said. “The government could have done something for mothers — we are also in quarantine.”",0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0

69,"Can relate in a way:

Our mother(-in law) was visiting us from China recently (went back early Jan.). During early December, we'd already picked up some news about 10+ people catching a ""weird lung virus"" in Wuhan. At that time, only a couple of English outlets reported on it (out of interest, I googled a bit for it back then -- I could recover the articles from my browser history, but hard to find with a Google search now since ""corona"" and ""pneumonia"" give back too much recent pages).

Anyway, skip forward a month, and now we're all worried (mother-in-law is back). We have family in Hunan, Beijing, and sadly, Wuhan as well (a city we have some very fond memories with). We've heard lunar new year is definitely not the same this year. Father-in-law has warned against posting in WeChat (""spreading rumors"", even whilst being very objective and just warning them to be safe). Me and my wife are in Europe, and tried looking online at our typical pharmaceutical shops to get some masks to send over. Conclusion: (good) masks sold out (in Europe!).

There's one thing we're thankful for, and that's us bringing 20 N99 masks to China in 2017. Our family members never used them (tucked it into a cupboard), but we've urged them to use them now when they go outside. Meanwhile, we're shipping a new batch (ultimately found online, but might take a while to arrive) + protective goggles. It's relatively costly, but better safe than sorry, I feel (we're keeping a set for ourselves here as well).

However, let me be clear -- speaking from where we are, outside of China: I don't think there's a reason to panic. But on the other hand, I know for a fact a lot of trouble could have been avoided if the local Wuhan admin jumped into the pond quicker. We were aware of this from about early December that something weird was going on. And given our history with the city, it's not the first time we see local politicians fucking it up over there. Wuhan could easily be a triple-A city next to Shanghai or Beijing. The only ""good"" to come out from this is that the central bureau will focus its sight closely on the administration there for the next couple of years.

My wish is this blows over soon and my family can rest easy. On the other hand: the moment the first case is confirmed in my country: I'm wearing that mask on the train. I'm teaching to 100s of students. I don't want to risk it.",0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
70,"&gt;Did people spend three weeks on this plane? A cruise ship is a confined space like a plane but the time on each differs massively and so do the number of people.

The problem isnt that only 1 or two other people have been infected. It's actually very likely that's the case, the problem is that due to so many false negatives coming from other countries, a 14 day incubation period where the infected are asymptomatic, and that fact that Chinese authorities suspect its airborne, and know for a fact that fecal plumes spread it (flush a toilet and it gets in the air and infects the next person), it is absolutely insane to assume only the people 3 rows around him were able to get it. If it infected someone else who had some degree of contact him then they will be in the regular population spreading the disease and they wont even know they had it until 2 weeks from now.

&gt;On a cruise ship, you'll have all 4000 people running through common areas.

Heres the problem with that. The quarantine started the moment they discovered someone infected. That single person either managed to independently infect over 600+ people, or it was still spreading somehow. There was originally concern that it was spreading through the air, but since there was still staff bringing meals they believed that was the primary vector.

That information, coupled with there being a chinese prison, and south Korean prison, having a cluster of outbreaks, proves that corona virus can even spread cell to cell. It's not good.

&gt;On a plane you go directly to your seat for a couple hours. Lots of differences. Am I wrong here?

The only reason why you are wrong is because that guy could have infected anyone. Literally anyone on that flight, and because we havent quarantined the entire plane it is possible that there are people in the general public infecting the rest of us. We wont know for a few weeks.",0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0
71,"Of  course it's going to get a lot of traffic so it could be clickbait; the Post is a tabloid...!  
HOWEVER, it does make some seemingly sensible arguments that bring into question the arguments presented in a FactCheck piece section on CoV-19's origin.  
In particular, some reasons/sub-questions that mean the answer to this question warrants an update:  


1.Applying Occam's razor, what's the most likely reason(s) that this announcement would be made when it was, despite the optics:

\[On Friday\], the  Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology released a new directive  entitled: “Instructions on strengthening biosecurity management in  microbiology labs that handle advanced viruses like the novel  coronavirus.""

I can't see any hierarchy of Chinese officials okaying such an announcement except under  intense pressure from, and to appease or pacify a group of research  scientists angry enough about the poor security to blow the whistle on it  having failed in THIS case.  


2.And  this is pretty strong circumstantial evidence too: ""\[H\]ow many  “microbiology labs” are there in China that handle “advanced viruses  like the novel coronavirus”?  


It  turns out that in all of China there is only one. And this one is  located in the Chinese city of Wuhan that just happens to be . . . the  epicenter of the epidemic.""  


3.And this three:

""Even the deadly SARS virus has escaped — twice — from the Beijing lab  where it was — and probably is — being used in experiments. Both  “man-made” epidemics were quickly contained, but neither would have  happened at all if proper safety precautions had been taken.""  


4.And this four:(and I'm not even including all of the evidence presented there):

""One  Beijing researcher, now in jail, made a million dollars selling his  monkeys and rats on the live animal market, where they eventually wound  up in someone’s stomach.""  


The only things that lean toward being exculpatory of the BSL-4 lab is the reputation of the news source and the byline bio of the author (he seems likely to have an anti-China bias) :

""Steven  W. Mosher is the President of the Population Research Institute and the  author of *Bully of Asia: Why China’s ‘Dream’ is the New Threat to  World Order*.""

5.The article doesn't mention it, but since January, China/the CCP has been **preventing** a team of virologists from the US from going to Wuhan to help/study the virus.

Do these things add up to proof *beyond a reasonable doubt*? No.  A preponderance of the evidence?  Quite possibly.  I haven't seen any good/serious counterarguments yet. 

I'm wondering:   
a.Has it been confirmed that bats were even sold at the seafood market generally named as the source?  

b.Where can I confirm the distance between the market and the lab?

c.Has it been confirmed that a bat could catch and pass on CoV-19?",1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

&gt; In an exclusive on the new coronavirus, the number of deaths greatly exceeds those release by the Chinese regime. Actual numbers could exceed official numbers by 10 times, with no less than 200 deaths per day in Wuhan.

&gt; Sources tell us the Hankou funeral cremator operates 24 hours a day. It has a capacity of 30 cremation furnaces.

&gt; For example, Hong Kong based media report an elderly woman named Leo Rong was sent to the isolation ward nine days after getting infected, but died within a few hours.

&gt; Her body was immediately sent to the Hankou funeral home for cremation.

&gt; According to the article, 14 to 20 creators were all operating around-the-clock.

&gt; It takes a crematorium on average 1.5 to 3 hours to process a body. So the total number of dead being processed by the 14 cremators of the Hankou Funeral Home would be closer to 112 to 224 per day.

&gt; On January 28th, an article surfaced on a number of mainland China news websites, titled: ""Wuhan Civil Affairs Bureau announces exemption of cremation charges for the remains of patients who died in the epidemic. The reason was the sheer number of family members complaining to the civil affairs bureau and the funeral home of the cost of delivering and cremating corpses. The usual cost is 12,000 yen. 

&gt; A manager of a funeral home in Wuhan told The Epoch Times that the government demanded all cremation of dead bodies due to the virus be handled by the Hankou Funeral Home. The government also supplied the funeral home with multiple vehicles to help meet the demand.

&gt; Amid tears, she explained there were more than 100 patients being seen by medical staff that day, and that the majority of them are now dead.

&gt; Since the Communist Party Health Committee began announcing the numbers of infected and dead on January 23rd, the ratio between the two has been around three.

76,"ANNISTON, Ala. — Not long before local leaders decided, in the words of one of them, that federal health officials “didn’t know what they were doing"" with their plan to quarantine novel coronavirus patients in town, a doctor here set out in a biohazard suit to stage a one-man protest along the highway with a sign. “The virus has arrived. Are you ready?” it asked.

The town didn’t think it was. Residents already were unnerved by strange stories posted on Facebook and shared via text messages about helicopters secretly flying in sick patients, that the virus was grown in a Chinese lab, that someone — either the media or the government — was lying to them about what was really going on.

The quarantine plan hastily hatched by the federal Department of Health and Human Services was soon scrapped by President Trump, who faced intense pushback from Alabama’s congressional delegation, led by Republican Rep. Mike D. Rogers. Americans evacuated after falling ill aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan would not be coming to Anniston, a town of 22,000 people in north-central Alabama, after all. They would remain in the same Texas and California sites where they were taken after leaving the cruise ship.

What happened here over the past week illustrates how poor planning by federal health officials and a rumor mill fueled by social media, polarized politics and a lack of clear communication can undermine public confidence in the response to the novel coronavirus, which causes the disease named covid-19. The rapidly spreading virus has rattled economies worldwide in recent weeks and caused the deaths of more than 2,900 people, mostly in China.

Read the latest news about the coronavirus

The panic and problems that burned through Anniston also provided a preview of what could unfold in other communities, as the spread of the virus is considered by health experts to be inevitable.

“Their little plan sketched out in D.C. was not thought out,” said Michael Barton, director of the emergency management agency in Calhoun County, where Anniston is located.

As local officials learned more, Barton added, “We knew then —”

“We were in trouble,” said Tim Hodges, chairman of the county commission.

In Anniston, local leaders were stunned to discover serious problems with the federal government’s plan for dealing with patients infected with the virus — starting with how the patients would get to Alabama, according to interviews with county and city officials, along with business leaders who dealt with the federal response.

“I was shocked,” Anniston Mayor Jack Draper said. “I was shocked by the lack of planning. I was shocked by the manner in which it was presented to us.”

Two HHS officials — Darcie Johnston, director of intergovernmental affairs, and Kevin Yeskey, principal deputy assistant secretary for preparedness and response — said in a Feb. 23 meeting with local officials that the patients would be flown from California to the Fort McClellan Army Airfield in Anniston, according to multiple local officials.

The airfield was closed when the Army base was shuttered in 1999. Local officials said they told the HHS officials during the meeting the runway was in bad shape.

“The more we talked,” Hodges said, “the more holes we found.”

The HHS plan also called for housing coronavirus patients at the Center for Domestic Preparedness, a FEMA facility on the old Army base and one of several redevelopment projects at the sprawling outpost.

The center has several brick dormitory buildings — behind tall black fencing — where federal officials planned for the patients to live. Federal officials even picked out the building they wanted to use for the first arrivals: Dorm No. 28, local officials said. A team of federal health workers would care for the patients and U.S. marshals would keep them from leaving the quarantine, local officials said they were told.

The dorms normally house emergency responders from around the country.

But the center doesn’t have any special capabilities for handling infectious diseases, local officials said. The center is used for training. It has isolation hospital rooms — located in a former Army hospital building — but they are mostly just props, with fake equipment and light switches that exist only as paint on walls.

Meanwhile, federal officials never contacted the town’s hospital, Regional Medical Center, about handling covid-19 patients, said Louis Bass, the hospital’s chief executive.

Yet HHS officials said in a statement released to the public Feb. 22 that patients who become seriously ill would be sent to “pre-identified hospitals for medical care.”

“We were surprised,” Bass said.

The hospital does have eight negative-pressure isolation rooms, but patients with serious complications would need to be sent to a larger institution, such as Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, 90 miles away, Bass said.",0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0

If you dropped people right into the middle of a Corona ad... they'd go stir crazy in less than 5 minutes, grab their phone, and log onto Facebook the whole time.  

To commune with nature and listen to the sound of the waves is literally far beyond the personal fortitude of most people.

Losing our ability to slow down is a very scary prospect.

Like seriously, you were bored to death and unhappy after a couple days in *Jamaica?*  If ever there was a place where you could, *cough cough* ""drift off,"" do what you want, listen to relaxing music, get some good exercise on the beach, be turned on with your partner, and watch interesting people making art... Sheesh.  

People also have a shocking lack of creativity in designing or maintaining their personal lives and routines.  Though, I blame that deficiency in part on our education systems.  Our culture is however improving and picking up the slack.    ",0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0
78,"It's really not so much about how deadly it is but the second and third order effects.

Others have talked about flattening the curve but really either option here has bad knock-on effects. So, the virulence is worse than the regular flu plus at least for the flu a significant amount of the population has a flu shot which will mitigate if not prevent one from catching it. 

One unfortunate part of colloquial English is that we tend to use ""the flu"" interchangably with ""the cold"" or other illnesses. ""Oh man, I caught the flu and it knocked me on my ass for a day."" ""Ugh, I had a really bad stomach flu and I shat for a day and a half"". No. Neither of those are the flu. I'm a healthy, active mid-40s guy and in January I had the flu for the first time in 15 years. I was absolutely miserable for 5 days and the thought of going to work was laughable. And that's with having had a flu shot in November and my being lucky enough to have a mild case.

So let's say this Coronavirus actually doesn't kill anyone. It's still a more infectious flu without any mitigation from a vaccine. Now if no preventative measures are taken at all huge swaths of the population will become sick very quickly. In modern capitalism there is almost no redundancy in the work force and having 10% of your coworkers call in sick for a week will impact productivity much more than 10% due to the reliance and expectation that everyone is doing their job and my task requires that your task be done which requires that Jane's task be completed and so on. Disrupt any of those and I'm screwed and so are the people relying on me completing my task. If there are 10% fewer workers to load grocery trucks at the warehouse, that leads to more than a 10% decrease of trucks being loaded. Same for factories in China. And if no preventative measures are taken, basically everyone will get infected and the supply chain effects will be massive. This does not even touch on the effects on hospitals and such, with huge amounts of people getting sick in a short period.

Now, let's say we try to mitigate the effects by closing factories when an outbreak is suspected. Now that factory is producing zero products for whatever period of time. Those workers probably aren't making money. The incidence of the virus spreads out over a longer period of time which is good for the healthcare system but the impact on goods and services is even more severe. 

We have not really felt the supply chain effects yet. They take time to trickle down to the consumer. Supply chain shortages + retail / warehouse laborers being out of work due to sickness or shutdowns will have massive economic effects that will affect us in an ever increasing manner for the next several months. That will lead to companies not wanting to spend money because they'll be struggling. That will lead to companies not hiring. That will lead to people having less money and spending less. That will lead to companies not wanting to spend money because they'll be struggling. It's a vicious circle. It's how economic depressions happen.",0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0

You want to know what alters Yum Brands stocks?

Real, physical shit. 

If there is an outbreak linked to a Yum Brand store. That hurts the stock. Pizza Hut is doing poorly, and that hurts the stock. Coronavirus is hurting the stock.

But it's tangible things I can track and work around.

""Buying"" Bitcoin as stock doesn't work because the booms/crashes aren't tied to real tangible actions, but actors. The people at the top largely know each other, and plan their sales. If you are in that top level you'll make off like a bandit. If you aren't the crash can happen in literally hours and you will/can lose everything.

Yum Brands isn't doing great. But it didn't happen overnight. It's been happening over months, partially due to Corona, partially due to Pizza Hut. Every step of that process I've been able to judge it, think about the worth, what I bought in at, my minimum sell price, and more. I'm able to judge whether I think the rebound will happen, when it will happen, and for how much. I'm able to look at previous data for Yum, and other restaurant Stocks and judge my response accordingly. 

I got Bitcoin from a friend once. In the course of a month it dropped several thousand dollars, went back up for more then it started, then dropped even lower then the initial crash. All in a month. Each of those crashes took place over 2-3 hour periods, so unless I was awake/staring at Bitcoin pricing all day I'd have missed them. That's not a viable financial asset.

80,"I posted this in another place, but it fits here too:

There are many other options, but they cost money, or require some form of community participation.

We could begin mass-producing PPE and teach everyone how to wear it. If we can rush wartime weapons for a World War, we can convert factories to making masks and goggles. Taiwan immediately ramped up production once infections grew in their country. The same could be done in the US. Instead, because it costs money, we're telling people not to wear masks, which has led to problems.

We could divert funds and research from organization such as the army, space research, and and ancillary functions of the government, to begin mass research into a vaccine.

Instead of waiting for a vaccine, we can begin trialing many drugs for treatment options that could lessen or reduce the case fatality rate as well as the severe symptoms. If we had some sort of treatment that could reduce or slow the effects of the virus, it would not be so dangerous.

We can hold mass information campaigns and try to educate people as much as possible about how the virus spreads, how transmission occurs, and the best mitigation strategies.

I know that it seems hopeless, but infecting hundreds of millions of people is going to lead to countless deaths. There are other options that are available at the moment, but governments are pushing the herd immunity line because it gets everyone back to work and gets the economy's up to speed faster. The drum beat for mass infection will grow louder and louder as the money makers and people behind the scenes start to feel the hurt in their wallets. Your average person will be kindling for the fire that rages across the planet. We can't let this idea gain hold, even if the people that pull the strings want it to happen.

Look at this like HIV. Back in the 80s, Reagan and the US government actually laughed at dying gay patients and ignore the effects of HIV until countless lives were lost. It only gained national attention once a little white boy died of a blood transfusion.

If the government continued on that trajectory into the 90s instead of changing fighting tactics, even more people would have died unnecessarily. of course as you know we do not have a vaccine for HIV, so what we did was treated through alternative methods. We got the word out to vulnerable populations and began mitigation strategies such as teaching people how to use protective gear. While we distributed prophylactics, drug manufacturers began researching treatments such as AZT. We began being more careful with blood transfusions and patient contact protocols with bodily fluids. While we did not completely eradicate HIV, and while it still kills many, many people, if we completely ignored it, the results would be even more catastrophic. Instead, now, we live with it as a fact of life, and have molded our behaviors and treatments around it, while researchers look into new medicines.

There are people out there in the world that are actually immune to HIV. Theoretically if we had everybody infected with HIV, the people left behind would be immune. But how many dead people would it take to reach that end goal? Instead, we teach people how to wear condoms (PPE). We hold classes in every high school that tell people about...genital social distancing.

How many dead people is it going to take to reach the herd immunity goal for the coronavirus? We can stack enough corpses to climb to that goal, sure. But who is going to be one of the steps?

Of course comparing coronavirus to HIV in terms of its lethality is not an accurate comparison. However, the situation regarding prevention and mitigation strategies is similar. It requires a mass education campaign, and a retooling of the way that we do things. Perhaps the goal is not to stop coronavirus completely, but to develop coping strategies for us to buy more time and to be a little more careful?",0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

According to Native Americans Wetiko is a “Virus” causing Selfishness.

As a Zoologist I find it interesting that it took a virus, Covid-19, to finally get Americans to understand the selfishness of personal profit causes extensive pain for very many of our citizens. Expect an increase in medical bankruptcies, home foreclosures and deaths due to the lack of Medicare for All. Why has Medicare for All been blocked since FDR? Wetiko.

Why is this greedy selfishness in humans so pervasive? We could go intro greedy politicians. For example the three Democratic Federal people that ""represent"" me in Washington state refuse to endorse Medicare for All, I've asked them to do so multiple times since 2015 to no avail. We could go into the greedy Health Insurance, Pharmaceutical companies and on and on but these are just specifics. What is the root of the problem?

The Y chromosome.

Yes it's man's fault. Seven thousand years ago with the advent of weapons that could easily kill ALL the males of an opposing tribe, men started self breeding for the trickiest killers. Here's the scientific article that explains why there is a lack of diversity in the Y chromosome. 

[Cultural hitchhiking and competition between patrilineal kin groups explain the post-Neolithic Y-chromosome bottleneck](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04375-6)

Kill all the males and breed with all the opposing tribe's women. 

So what is this saying? It explains why politician's prefer money over people, why the Koch brother's ""want it all"", why Medicare for All has not happened in the U.S.A.

What's the solution? Social mechanisms that prevent ""Kill them All"" mentality from crashing the ship of state on the rocks. Currently our institutions have a patriarchal profit over people driven structure controlled by corporations. Our only chance to turn this around is to recognize Wetiko in our culture and create social constructs to contain it's evil effects.

The source article is in an interview with a Ministry of Health official.

Những biện pháp mạnh để chống dịch ở Việt Nam - VnExpress

Some notable details about the quarantine measures Vietnam (of the 10,000 people in Son Loi commune after initial 8 cases found) has taken mentioned in the article and other interviews:

The Sơn Lôi cluster is controlled by a 4-ring system. This is an additional ring in comparison to the 3-ring system used during the SARS outbreak in 2003 by the Vietnamese MoH:

Ring 1: The infected patients (F1) and family members (potential F2) are quarantined at the local hospital quarantine zone. Ring 1 will not accept any new patients unrelated to covid-19. Hospital staffs are also locked in. If a case goes bad, the ambulance and medical staffs stationed nearby will ship the patient immediately to the central level hospital. Electronic reports. The AC is turned off in case the virus can spread to other parts of the building by the central HVAC like SARS and MERS. Windows are opened for fresh air and sunlight.

Ring 2: The potential F3 - the people who have had close contact with the potential F2, are quarantined in group at the newly prepared temporary military base equipped with the necessary medical equipment. Health check is done every day by the local militia, the soldiers, and the military medical staffs at base. Medical staffs and ambulance stationed nearby will ship cases showing symptoms to Ring 1. No AC. Windows are opened for fresh air and sunlight.

Ring 3: The potential F4 - the people who have had close contact with the potential F3, are quarantined at home. Health check is done every day by the local militia, the soldiers, and the local healthcare professionals.

Ring 4: The entire commune has to pass health check at the posts surrounding the commune and goes to the sanitizing process of having sanitizers spraying all over their faces and objects. In the case that someone outside of ring 3 shows symptoms, the entire ring 4 will be on complete lock down. Surrounding the commune, the military corp and military medical staffs assigned to the job stand on guard outside the commune for health check post, giving people emergency treatment for other health emergencies, and shipping people inside the ring outside if they’re not infected and have other health emergencies to other nearby healthcare facilities. Additional standby groups of soldiers, military medical staffs, and logistic corps are stationed around the Bình Xuyên district and around the Vĩnh Phúc province for emergency mobilization (i.e. in case the cluster escapes the Sơn Lôi containment). Field hospitals are built nearby just in case.

All confirmed cases’ houses are sanitized and closed off for 14 days.

Staffs in the rings are equipped with PPE. Civilians in the rings are given free medical masks.

Food and other essentials for the staffs and the civilians are taken care of by the logistic corp according to military standard. Transportation of food and other essentials in the rings is conducted by the militia and soldiers stationed inside each ring.

Vietnamese nationals returning from infected areas are quarantined at temporary military barracks similar to the people in ring 2. But now with the patients encouraged to work out in the open fields too.

Cured cases, especially super shredder cases like the F1 who started the Sơn Lôi cluster, are continued to be quarantined in hospitals just in case unless they’re not Vietnamese nationals and are accepted back by their home countries.

All schools in the country take the days off till (at least) the end of Feb.

Border transaction and transportation between Vietnam and China are severely limited even now (1 land border crossing facility -&gt; 3 land border crossing facilities in operation yesterday). In all 3 facilities in operation, the sanitizing process is applied to both the trains and the people driving the train. The drivers live in quarantine zones (ring 2 level of quarantine). All other Vietnamese official border crossing facilities and footpaths with China, Laos, and Cambodia are guarded by the local militia and military corps. All airports are close to mainland China. All people from outside country regardless of nationality have to go through the thermal scan and a healthcheck at the airport. People who have been to the epidemic regions within 14 days are barred from going to the country. The airport checking teams have the supporting team of medical staffs, soldiers, and ambulance on standby near the checkpoints. The gov might or might not expand the ban to other regions and countries depending on how the epidemic fares in other regions and countries. Edit:

Medical mask distribution and sanitizers are prioritized to be shipped to the hospital system and people whose works put them at risk with the infection. Hospitals give out masks for free for patients. The rest are distributed to the market. Stores selling masks and sanitizers at too high a price compared to the original price are heavily fined by the local Market Regulation offices. Civilians are allowed to only buy a limited amount of masks (around 5–10 per person). Stores are allowed to only sell a limited amount of masks to each customer (around 5–10).

The national market and some significant chains are asked to save the products impacted by the border restriction with China.

The military, the Military Medical University, the MoH, other healthcare institutions and universities, and private Vietnamese enterprises are asked to cooperate with each other to study the virus, isolate the virus (successful, one of the first countries to do so), develop Vietnam’s own testing kit (successful, RT-LAMP technique, 70 min), and eventually develop Vietnam’s own vaccine (ETA 18 months at the earliest). Just in case.

TL;DR: Listening to WHO’s advice at the beginning of the epidemic would have been a terrible decision lol. +1 for paranoia. Vietnam has learnt the lessons well from SARS. Vietnam’s slogans are “fight the epidemic like you would fight a war”, “the epidemic is a war"", “just in case”, and “better be safe than sorry”.",0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

 **Abstract**: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an acute infectious disease that spreads mainly via the respiratory route. A distinct coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has been identified as the aetiological agent of SARS. Recently, a metallopeptidase named angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as the functional receptor for SARS-CoV. AlthoughACE2 mRNA is known to be present in virtually all organs, its protein expression islargely unknown. Since identifying the possible route of infection has major implications for understanding the pathogenesis and future treatment strategies for SARS, the presentstudy investigated the localization of ACE2 protein in various human organs **(oral and nasalmucosa, nasopharynx, lung, stomach, small intestine, colon, skin, lymph nodes, thymus, bonemarrow, spleen, liver, kidney, and brain)**. The most remarkable finding was the surface expression of ACE2 protein on lung alveolar epithelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine. Furthermore, ACE2 was present in arterial and venous endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells in all organs studied. In conclusion, ACE2 is abundantly present in humans in the epithelia of the lung and small intestine, which might provide possible routes of entry for the SARS-CoV. This epithelial expression, together with the presence ofACE2 in vascular endothelium, also provides afirst step in understanding the pathogenesis of the main SARS disease manifestations.Copyright2004 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

87,"This dr articulates why the 'plan' study that you referenced is a bad one...From a dr responding directly the the epidemic in the UK. So i dont think we need to wait a year. 


""I'm sad to say that I do have the details, and there has been intense discussion about this over the past weeks. To answer your question: ""herd immunity"" would have been a beneficial outcome to slowing virus growth to a prolonged period of time. It was not a primary outcome.

That said, the official policy was wholly wrong and when all the dust has settled, when all the costs and lives have been counted, people have to make their governments accountable.

I'll tell you what happened in the UK.

Over the past decade, eminent figures in public health developed complex models that would help inform the UK response to a pandemic. The response plan would allow slow spread through a population and a number of deaths that would be deemed acceptable in relation to low economic impact. Timing of population measures such as social distancing would be taken, not early, but at a times deemed to have maximal psychological impact. Measures would be taken that could protect the most vulnerable, and most of the people who got the virus would hopefully survive. Herd immunity would beneficially emerge at the end of this, and restrictions could relax. This was a ground-breaking approach compared to suppressing epidemics. It was an approach that could revolutionise the way we handled epidemics. Complex modelling is a new science, and this was cutting edge.

But a model is only ever as good as the assumptions you build it upon. The UK plan was based on models with an assumption that any new pandemic would be like an old one, like flu. And it also carried a huge flaw - there was no accounting for the highly significant variables of ventilators and critical care beds that are key to maintaining higher survival numbers ([https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/health/2020/03/government-documents-show-no-planning-ventilators-event-pandemic](https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/health/2020/03/government-documents-show-no-planning-ventilators-event-pandemic)).

So, come 2020 and COVID-19 causes disaster in China, Iran and Italy. Epidemiologists and doctors from around the world observe, and learn valuable lessons:

1. the virus is insidious with a long incubation, any population actions you take will only have an effect weeks later
2. the virus spreads remarkably quickly and effectively
3. **the virus causes an unusually large proportion of patients to require invasive ventilatory support**
4. early large scale testing, and social distancing measures, are effective at stopping exponential growth
5. **stopping exponential growth is VITAL to preventing your critical care systems from being overwhelmed.**

Everyone in the world could see these things. But despite this, very few governments chose to act.

The UK did the opposite of acting. In an act of what I see as sheer arrogance and British exceptionalism, they chose to do nothing, per the early stages of their disaster plan. There was some initial contact tracing, but this stopped when it was clear that there was significant community spread and exponential growth. And after this? They did not ramp up testing capabilities. They did not encourage social distancing. They did not boost PPE supply, or plan for surge capacity. They ignored advice from the WHO, public health experts in other country; epidemiologists, scientists and doctors in their own. I can tell you with certainty now that they did not even collect regular statistics for how many COVID patients were being admitted to critical care in the UK. They did nothing.

What were they thinking? Maybe that what had happened in China, and was happening in Italy, couldn't possibly happen in the UK, right? It was **impossible**. And this plan that great minds had been planning for a decade, this was the perfect time to test it out!

Well COVID-19 is not flu. That is perfectly clear. And it was clear that the UK numbers were following, exponentially, the same trend as Italy. But still the government and their advisers stuck to their guns and put out reassuring messages. I would ask here - **why did they still think we would be different?**

Finally, a team at Imperial informing the government's response put up-to-date COVID-19 data into the historical models that the UK plan was based on ([https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf)), and predicted in a best case scenario 250,000 deaths and excess of 8x surge capacity of UK intensive cares. They concluded that our approach was wrong, and that ""Epidemic suppression is the only viable strategy at the current time"".

Where are we now?

1. The government has instituted a number of measures that they previously called ""unscientific"", but has not mandated them.
2. We are far, far into the exponential curve both in deaths and critical care numbers, and there is at least two weeks more growth until any of the half-hearted measures taken might kick in.
3. We do not have sufficient testing capability for even hospital patients, who sometimes wait days for a test result. There are not enough tests for anyone in the community, or any healthcare workers who might have symptoms.
4. Hospitals are scrambling to produce surge capacity, and several smaller hospitals in London are now overwhelmed with COVID and out of ventilators.
5. There is clearly not enough PPE in the country and we are rushing to secure supplies.

Don't believe the UK government propaganda when they say that they are only advancing along the same plan at a faster pace. It is total bollocks. Their plan was wrong, kaput, totally broken. They chose to perform an experiment on an entire population, a trial of 'new epidemic mitigation strategy in UK' vs 'epidemic suppression in rest of the world'. They refused to listen to experts from all over the world because of sheer arrogance, and in their arrogance they did not observe the lessons that were there, plain to see. **They have backtracked completely and are now doing what most world public health experts and what the WHO asked them to do in the first place.** They've wasted a month, at least.

Will they suffer? Hell no. It will be the vulnerable in the population, the unlucky young, and the medical staff at the front line.

For example, the BBC's Stephen McDonell (one of their China correspondents who's based out of China and Hong Kong) was writing multiple analyses weekly (and even multiple daily for a few days) for articles posted on the BBC's mobile app during the protests in Hong Kong, and is now doing the same in his coverage of Covid-19.  If you're writing thousands upon thousands of words weekly that often get published within hours of being written you're likely to make mistakes, and the editors are likely to let some of them slip through to the final publication.  

These aren't print publications, so they've likely decided that it's better to get something out ASAP that will drive traffic and earn ad revenue and revise any mistakes post-publication, rather than sitting on it too long while its painstakingly edited, allowing a competitor to break the news first.  It'd be all but inexcusable in print, but when it's on a hastily written and quickly posted online article which eventually gets amended I don't think it's that big of a deal.",1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

• Effective from midnight Sunday, all travellers, except for those coming from the Pacific islands, will have to self-isolate for 14 days on their arrival to New Zealand
• The PM says the rules are the toughest in the world 
• She told New Zealanders not to travel overseas if they don't have to and issued stark advice: no hugs, hongi or handshakes
• All cruise ships have been asked to not come to NZ until June 30
• There will also be further announcements on mass gatherings

Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has announced all travellers will have to self-isolate on their arrival to New Zealand, apart from those coming from the Pacific Islands.

She said the measures - in effect as of midnight Sunday - include New Zealanders.

The restrictions will be reviewed in 16 days and there will be more advice for self-isolation next week. There were already clear guidelines for employers on sick pay and working-from-home advice.

It will be the strictest border restriction rules in the world, Arden said.

""I make no apologies. This is an unprecedented time.

""If you don't need to travel overseas, then don't. Enjoy your own backyard for a time. Stop handshakes, hugs and hongi.

""We are a tough, resilient people. We have been here before.

""We are taking every step we can as a Government.

""Look after your family, look after your older ones.""

All cruise ships are also being asked to not come to New Zealand until June 30. It does not apply for cargo ships.

Essential air freight will still be allowed to enter the country for things like pharmaceuticals.

There will also be further announcements on mass gatherings based on the criteria of: large events in close proximity, events that are non ticketed and events that have a large overseas number of people.

There was no decided number on how many people constituted a mass gathering but the overseas criteria of 500-1000 was similar to what the government was considering.

""We understand these decisions are disappointing people but we have to prioritise people's health,"" Ardern said.

Up until today, travel restrictions in New Zealand included preventing foreign nationals travelling from or transiting through mainland China or Iran from entering New Zealand.

People exempt from the temporary restrictions were self-isolating for 14 days after their return.

People who had been in Italy or the Republic of Korea (excluding airport transfer) were required to self-isolate for 14 days after their return.

And people who had travelled to Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore and Thailand (excluding airport transit) are being asked to aware of coronavirus symptoms but do not need to self-isolate if they are well.

The new travel restrictions will be a massive hit to Air New Zealand, 52 per cent owned by the Government. Around 41 per cent of the airline's $6 billion annual revenue comes from international flights.

While it dominates domestic flying, it has already scaled back some domestic routes because of falling demand from business travellers. On Monday it said it could no longer forecast its profit because of uncertainty over the future of air travel.

Its share price has plunged since the start of the year when the coronavirus became known and the company has lost nearly half of its market capitalisation.

Other airlines serving New Zealand will also move quickly to change their schedules.

Ardern said New Zealand was already registering all travelers who are self isolating once entering NZ the PM said. 10,500 people have already self isolated in NZ.

The PM says our pandemic which hits hard and fast must be dealt with by ""flattening the curve"" to have the rate of cases in the right place - either at home on in hospital if needed.

""We must go hard and fast.""

A smaller number of cases have allowed New Zealand ""to care for them in the right place,"" the PM said.

""We must plan and prepare for more cases.""

She urged people there was no need for anyone to ""take a run on their supermarket"".

No one else in cabinet is self isolating besides Tracey Martin, she said.

The parliamentary speaker has been considering business continuity cases for self isolation of MPs and parliamentary staff.

The World Health Organisation has declared the coronavirus a pandemic as the number of confirmed cases globally reaches 145,000. Just over 5400 people have died. Almost 70,000 people have recovered.

It was announced today New Zealand now has its sixth positive case of the coronavirus, an Auckland man.

There also two probable cases of Covid-19 in New Zealand.

Aged in his 60s, the man recently returned to New Zealand from New Jersey, United States and was at home recovering in self-isolation.

Ardern said New Zealand had the capacity to test 1000 people a day. They were looking to increase that number.

""Every medial professional has the ability to test who they think needs to be tested. At their discretion.""

Waitematā District Health Board chief executive Dr Dale Bramley confirmed the news to the media on Saturday afternoon.

Bramley was alerted to the sixth case on Friday and the man, who was doing well at home, did not require hospital treatment.

There was still no community spread of the virus, Bramley said.

Flying home from New Jersey via Houston, no one else on the flight should be alarmed because they were not regarded as being close contact, he said, because the feeling unwell until more than three days after he arrived back in the country, the Ministry of Health said in a statement.

The man did attend the 8.30am service at St Mary's church on East St, Papakura before he became unwell and as a precaution. Close contacts were being contacted and put into self-isolation.

Family contacts of the man would also be offered testing and contact tracing was under way in Auckland, the ministry said.

The sixth confirmed case would be monitored daily by health services, Bramley said.

After starting to feel ill, the man did everything right by phoning ahead to his doctor and telling them of his travel history, about a possible link and his symptoms.

He was then assessed in his car by his GP, who was wearing the appropriate protective equipment.

Protective gear, which includes a gown, goggles, face mask, and gloves had been sent to 420 GP practices across Auckland, Bramley said.",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0
92,"In just two months the world economy has been turned upside down. Stockmarkets have collapsed by a third and in many countries factories, airports, offices, schools and shops have been closed to try to contain the virus. Workers are worried about their jobs and investors fear companies will default on their debts. All this points to one of the sharpest economic contractions in modern times. China’s gdp probably shrank by 10-20% in January and February compared with a year earlier. For as long as the virus rages, similar drops are likely in America and Europe, which could trigger a further downward lurch in Asia. Massive government intervention is required to ensure that this shock does not spiral into a depression. But scale alone is not good enough—new financial tools need to be deployed, and fast.

Western authorities have already promised huge sums. A crude estimate for America, Germany, Britain, France and Italy, including spending pledges, tax cuts, central-bank cash injections and loan guarantees, amounts to $7.4trn, or 23% of their gdp (see Briefing). Yet central banks are responsible for over four-fifths of that and many governments are doing too little. A huge array of policies is on offer, from holidays on mortgage-payments to bail-outs of Paris cafés. Meanwhile, orthodox stimulus tools may not work well. Interest rates in the rich world are near zero, depriving central banks of their main lever. Governments typically try to stimulate demand in a downturn but people trapped at home cannot spend freely. History is not much of a guide. The global pandemic of 1918 took place when the economy was wrecked by war. China has endured a lockdown but its social model is different from the West’s.

What to do? An economic plan needs to target two groups: households and companies. And it needs to be fast, efficient and flexible so that if the virus retreats only to resurge, workers and firms can be confident that governments will dial assistance down and up again as needed. Start with households, where large government spending is needed. One aim is to protect vulnerable people, by subsidising sick pay and ensuring those without insurance have health care. But spending is also needed to discourage lay-offs at firms running far below capacity, by subsidising workers’ wages—an area where Germany has led the way.

https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/985/85/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20200321_LDC815.png

Governments also need to jerry-rig digital systems so they are able to distribute cash to households directly, as Hong Kong hopes to. The aim should be to have the capability to ramp further support up and down quickly. Many places, including America, rely on sluggish postal services and tax agencies to distribute cash. If funds can be sent instantly through mobile phones or online bank accounts, people will feel more confident and avoid hoarding cash and slowing the recovery when the virus recedes.

All this spending will cost governments dear, but the fiscal stimulus of about 1% of gdp so far across Europe is clearly too low. America’s plan to spend 5% is closer to the mark given the risk of a double-digit gdp drop. As fiscal deficits balloon, governments will have to issue piles of bonds. Central banks should step in to buy those bonds in order to keep yields low and markets orderly. Inflation is a second-order concern and there is little danger of it taking off. To prevent a euro-zone crisis, the European Central Bank plans to buy €750bn of assets. But it and European governments should also give a clear guarantee of sovereign support for Italy and other peripheral economies.

The second priority is to get cash to millions of companies, whose failure would damage the economy’s potential. They face a cash drought even as bills fall due. Bond markets are closed to many of them. Mass defaults would fuel unemployment and bad debts at banks, and make it harder for commercial activity to rebound. Most governments have intervened, but in flawed ways. France says nationalisation is an option—which firms will resist. America is propping up the commercial-paper market, but this funds only a fraction of all corporate debt and is used by big firms—not small ones, which employ most people. Germany and Britain have offered loan-guarantee schemes but it is unclear who will process millions of loan applications. The best approach is to use the banking system—almost all firms have accounts, and banks know how to issue loans. Governments should offer banks cheap funding to lend to their clients while guaranteeing that it will bear most of the losses. Borrowers could be offered bonuses for repaying loans early.

There are huge drawbacks to all of this. Public and corporate debt will soar. Handouts will be given to rich people and loans extended to firms that are badly run. But even with this fearful list of side-effects, the advantages are overwhelming. Cash will be distributed fast. Vulnerable people will be able to get by. Households will be confident enough to spend when conditions improve. And firms will keep their workforces and plants intact, ready to get back to action when this dark episode has passed.",0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0
93,"In the case of SARS there were asymptotic or late-symptom- onset “super-spreaders” such as Dr. Liu Jianlun who infected at least 16 other guests in a hotel where he was staying. One of the infected got it just from pushing an elevator button Jianlun touched. It took days for the Dr himself to fall ill. He eventually died. In the case of nCoV, most people who eventually die start with symptoms of cold or flu. The virus doesn’t cause pneumonia symptoms (fluid in the lungs) until 9-10 days after initial symptoms appear as far as we know right now. 
I’m wondering if infection of a previous mild corona virus lessens the symptoms of nCoV. That can happen with related illnesses. Milkmaids who were exposed to cowpox rarely sickened with smallpox, for example. There is one case where an adult son visiting his parents and his dad got nCoV but the mother didn’t, so had she already developed immunity due to a prior infection with a different corona virus?

94,"Since COVID-19 has begun it’s ‘journey’ to become a worldwide problem some time ago, people are buying out almost all hygiene products. Hand sanitizers, cleansing wipes, facemasks and other protective gear, everything is slowly becoming extinct. That’s why I thought it would be a good idea to come up with a DIY-recipe for a hand sanitizer that actually works. I have read a wide range of different DIY recipes online and after many tweaking sessions, I came up with this recipe. I know that making your own(working)hand sanitizer may sound like something only scientists would be able to do, but trust me, with the right ingredients it’s actually pretty simple(all of the ingredients can be found on Amazon. Regarding the oils I use, I recommend you to search for ‘essential oils gift box’, as these boxes are cheap and contain most of the oils for this recipe).

Before you dive into the details, always remember these steps when applying hand sanitizer:

1. Apply a dime-size amount to the palm of one hand. 
2. Rub your hands together for 30 seconds, covering all surfaces of both hands, including between your fingers and up around your fingertips and nails. 
3. Allow your hands to completely absorb the product and don’t touch anything untill your hands are completely dry. 
4. Use a suitable moisturizer for your hands after desinfecting them.


Alright, let’s see what we know about our ingredients:


- Tea Tree Oil:

Loads of studies have shown that we should keep this one closest to us during outbreaks, as it has a wide spectrum of properties, including: antifungal, antimicrobial, antiseptic, antiviral, and antibacterial.

- Lemongrass Oil:

Some say it’s the boring cousin of Tea Tree oil, but with it’s antibacterial and antifungal properties, you should always invite him to your party!

- Lavender Oil:

Well known antibacterial and antiviral product that has the benefit of smelling really fresh.

- Peppermint Oil:

This is one of my personal favorites, as it dates back as far as ancient Greece. It has antibacterial properties, helps the skin and also keeps your hands smell fresh.

- Vitamin-E oil:

Moisturizer and it keeps the skin balance healthy in a 100% natural way.

- Sage Oil:

This lil’ baby already proved that it possesses antiviral properties during the fight against SARS. 

- Aloe vera gel:

Does pretty much the same job as the Vitamin-E oil, but it adds some antibacterial and antifungal properties to the mix.


Recipe for 100 mL of DIY-hand sanitizer:

- 25 drops of Tea Tree oil

- 5 drops of Lemongrass oil
       
- 5 drops of Lavender oil
       
- 5 drops of Peppermint oil
       
- 10 drops of Sage oil

- 15 mL Vitamin-E oil

- 30 mL Aloe Vera gel

- 50 mL 120 proof Everclear, grain alcohol(120 proof means 60% alcohol)


Noteworthy:

- If you want to make more than 100 mL, adjust the ingredients accordingly, but don’t go too heavy on the Everclear.
- If you’re allergic to some of these ingredients, leave them out and search for a substitute with similar properties.
- Lemongrass oil, Sage oil and Peppermint oil shouln’t be used when pregnant or lactating. They should also be kept away from young children.

95,"The Senate, voting 12-0, approved a bill declaring the existence of a national emergency and granting President Rodrigo Duterte additional powers to address the COVID-19 crisis.

Among the new powers the bill seeks to give to Duterte is the authority to reshuffle savings within the executive department in the 2020 budget into addressing the crisis brought about by the viral disease, including assistance to the poor who have been adversely affected by the lockdown in Luzon.

It also gives Duterte the power to allocate cash, funds, investments, unused or unreleased subsidies in government corporations or any national government agency to address the COVID-19 emergency.

It also seeks to allow Duterte to direct the stoppage of programs, projects or activities under the executive department, including government corporations, and use the savings from these to fund the government’s response to COVID-19.

Under the Senate’s proposal, the Health Department is prioritized for funding sourced from the halting of certain government programs. It will receive funding for its hospitals, the prevention and control of other infectious diseases, emergency preparedness and response, and a boost in its quick response fund.

The Senate also wants unutilized or unreleased special purpose funds to be rechanneled to be used in the government’s fight against COVID-19.

Senator Pia Cayetano, who sponsored the measure, said funds from these sources will be used to distribute P5,000 to P8,000 a month to some 18 million families, which will amount to roughly P200 billion in two months.

“The cost is clearly significant but we have the cash available. What we do not have is the flexibility to use the available cash to beat this virus. This bill that I sponsor today will precisely do that,” Cayetano said.

All the powers that the Senate seeks to grant Duterte will remain in effect for at least three months or until the state of calamity in the entire country is lifted.

Absent from the proposal is Malacañang’s bid to allow Duterte to take over businesses, which Cayetano said had never been present in her and Senate President Vicente “Tito” Sotto III’s version of the bill.

Instead, Duterte may direct the operation of privately-owned hospitals, medical facilities, passenger vessels and other establishments to house health workers, serve as quarantine areas, become quarantine centers, medical and aid centers or temporary health facilities, and serve as transportation for health workers.

The management of these businesses and establishments will be retained, and they will be compensated for any damage they may sustain as a result of Duterte taking charge of their operations.

It also allows Duterte to buy goods, including personal protective equipment, thermometers, cleaning agents and medicine, as long as the Health Department prioritizes the distribution of these to public health facilities tagged as COVID-19 referral hospitals, private hospitals that treat patients with the viral disease and public and private labs that test for it.

The measure also grants Duterte the power to require businesses to prioritize and accept contracts for materials and services needed to combat COVID-19.

Under the proposal, Duterte can also regulate public and private transportation, traffic, and the use of power, fuel, energy and water.

Duterte has already placed the entire country under a state of calamity lasting for six months and has placed Luzon on a so-called enhanced community quarantine, severely restricting the movement of people.

Over 400 people in the Philippines have acquired COVID-19, with 33 of them dying because of the disease caused by a virus called SARS CoV-2. Eighteen of those infected have recovered.

Globally, over 339,000 have been infected and 14,705 have died because of the viral disease. Over 98,000 have recovered.

The disease is spread through small droplets from the nose or mouth when people infected with the virus cough or sneeze.

To prevent infection, authorities are urging people to practice regular hand washing, cover their mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, and avoid close contact with those who show respiratory symptoms.",0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0

When you think about it, this virus has been incredibly successful. It jumped to humans a few months ago (from what we know), and seems to have found an ideal host for propagation. It's replicating like crazy, which, I assume means lots and lots of opportunities for copying errors. 

It seems to be doing pretty well for itself, so it doesn't look like there is much pressure pushing it to adapt, though, so maybe not. I've read that SARS, which this virus is closely related to, has a ""molecular proofreading system"" that reduces it's mutation rate.

JUST IN: SECRET BEHIND THE CORONAVIRUS LEAKED.   
 """"""""""""""'''""'""""''''""""""""""''""""  
 I am a senior Chinese military intelligence officer and I know the truth about the coronavirus outbreak. It is far worse than the media are telling you.  
 I am a Chinese citizen in Wuhan who occupies — or   perhaps occupied — a high-ranking position in military intelligence. I  am also a member of the Chinese Communist Party. As a senior official near the top of the Party, I have access to a great deal of classified  information and I have been involved in many top-secret government  projects. I have a doctorate from a leading university in a western country, which is why I am able to write my account in English.

I  have information that I believe could lead to the overthrow of my government. It is also relevant to billions of people outside of China,  all of whom are now in existential peril.

It will not surprise  you to hear that if my identity were to be revealed, my life would be in  grave danger, as would those of my wife and son. I ask you to respect the fact that I have stripped out of this account all facts that would  make it easy to identify me.

By now you will be familiar with the  recent outbreak of 2019-nCoV, also known as NCP, or simply  ""coronavirus"". You will have heard that it originated in Wuhan, an  industrial city in China, and that it came from an animal — most likely a  bat or a pangolin — that was sold in a wild animal market. You will  have been told that it is an influenza-like illness that can in severe  cases cause pneumonia, respiratory failure and death. Finally, you may  have heard that although the disease is highly infectious, it is  dangerous only to the elderly or to those who have a compromised immune  system. The official lethality rate is approximately 2% or so.

 All of that is a bunch of lies concocted by the Chinese state with the  tacit support of the U.S. deep state and its friends in the European  Union, Russia and Australia, and spread by the docile media in all of  those countries.

Let me start by telling you that the world does  not operate the way you think it does. Although countries like the US  and China vie for global dominance, that competition is restricted to  certain limited areas. In most ways, the two countries are more  interested in cooperation so that they can stop other competing  countries from gaining more power. They also have a shared interest in  keeping real power out of the hands of their ""ordinary"" citizens. To  this end, they have many different mechanisms by which they control the  overwhelming majority of their media outlets. The Americans in  particular have perfected the art of creating made-up ""divisions""  between their two main parties which are designed to hide the fact that  both serve the same masters.

These same nations also posses  technology that is far more advanced than you can imagine and which is  kept carefully hidden from public view. This includes advanced  artificial intelligence capable of undermining and deciding any election  in the world; biological and chemical agents that can manipulate and  control the thinking patterns and behaviours of citizens to terrifying  degrees; highly sophisticated manipulation techniques using hypnotic  practices entirely unknown to the public; and other things that I will  not go into now. My point is that the great nations do not compete so  much as work together. Their principal goal is to shield the true  workings of the world from the ""uninitiated"" public.

Just to give  you one example, there aren’t actually any nuclear weapons anywhere in  the world. The U.S. and the Soviet Union scrapped them all in the 1970s,  as did their client states. Everyone realised that those weapons could  not be used without destroying the whole world, so there was no need for  them; but by pretending that they still had them, the big players were  able to keep the non-nuclear powers in line.

Among the many outlandish statements President Trump has made since taking office, one in particular stands out for me.
Speaking in Kansas City, Mo., in the summer of 2018, he urged the attendees of the VFW annual convention to ignore the journalism of the mainstream media.
“Just stick with us, don’t believe the crap you see from these people, the fake news,” he said. “What you’re seeing and what you’re reading is not what’s happening.”
In other words, if you didn’t hear from me or my minions, it isn’t true.
Chico Marx memorably expressed a similar idea in the 1933 comedy “Duck Soup”: “Who ya gonna believe — me or your own eyes?”
It’s a dumbfounding notion, especially given Trump’s proven propensity for lies and falsehoods. But now as a deadly disease, the coronavirus, threatens to turn into a full-blown pandemic, it’s not simply bizarre in a way that can be easily shrugged off. It’s not just Trump being Trump.

And it’s definitely not funny. It’s dangerous.
Coronavirus: live updates, latest news

Trump and his chosen spokespeople are attempting to dramatically play down the seriousness of the coronavirus and to blame the legitimate news media for doing their jobs of informing the public.

In reporting what Trump has to say, the news media has a huge responsibility not to repeat and amplify his misleading spin — a spin that may serve his political interests but is not in the public interest.
It’s not always easy, though, for mainstream journalists to put his claims in the proper context.
After all, it had always been normal to let a president have his say — to let his statements top the news while letting the fact checks follow.
AD

That has changed somewhat during the lie-ridden Trump administration, but not nearly enough. The reflexive media urge, deep in our DNA, is still to quote the president without offering an immediate challenge.
That’s why we continue to see headlines and chyrons that parrot his words directly, no matter how misleading: That the virus will disappear, that it’s not inevitable that the disease will spread, that a vaccine is coming along “rapidly,” that the United States is “very, very ready” to deal with whatever happens.
How chyrons took on a life of their own in the Trump era

When journalists do push back with fact checks or with dissenting sources from the worlds of science and medicine, Trump and the administration attack the messengers. Sometimes that takes the form of disparaging tweets such as one from Wednesday in which he charged cable networks MSNBC and CNN of “panicking markets” and in which he bragged “USA in great shape!”

Their logic seems to be that the drastic stock market declines in recent days are the result of media overkill, not legitimate business concerns. “What I might do to calm the markets is turn the television off for 24 hours,” was acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney’s advice Friday to the audience at the Conservative Political Action Conference.
Conservative pundits blame a grab bag of supposed villains amid the coronavirus outbreak

Some months ago, I wrote about the linguist George Lakoff’s prescription for handling the president’s false statements and lies, an approach that’s become known as the “truth sandwich.”
Rather than lead with the falsehood and then try to debunk it, Lakoff — an expert on how propaganda works — suggested flipping that formula: Lead with the truth, air the falsehood, and then follow with the fact check.
AD

Avoid giving prominence to lies, he advises. Don’t put them in headlines, leads or tweets. It is that very amplification that gives them power, even if they are proclaimed false in the next beat.

Too often, Lakoff told me, the media “has become complicit with Trump by allowing itself to be used as an amplifier for his falsehoods and frames.” And that’s true even when journalists make lists of lies. It’s the repetition and the prominence that does the harm.
AD

Trump’s tendency to spin out assertions untethered from reality becomes a recipe for disaster when combined with his disdain for scientists, medical experts, intelligence officials, journalists and others who deal in fact-based reality.
Add in the dangers of a disease rapidly approaching pandemic proportions, and it becomes more important than ever to emphasize truthful information over false spin.
I’m convinced that we in the media, with all our obvious faults, have learned some things about covering Trump over the past four years. Now would be an excellent time to put it into practice.

Tartar communists already killed one billion infants on race. Hundreds of millions of infants was killed by sticks and fists when they were still in their mothers' uteri， and moreover, hundreds of millions of infants were killed when they just saw this world, all because of their race. But just one one cares.

**If you are a typical chinese, you can only have one child, and the rest of your infants must be killed under the order of tartar communists. But if you are a tartar, you can have two and more children, admitted by the tartar communists and written in public laws ! ! !**

Do you really believe poor china decades ago had enough qualified drugs to kill infants on race in birth control on race ? Do you really believe tartar communists would always nicely and politely give you drugs to kill your infants on race?

Note :

CCP government admitted by themselves they eliminated about half a billion infants already. And it's reasonable to think CCP government would cover some of the evil. And tartar population without control is five times from the start. So, it is reasonable to estimate one billion infants were killed on race by the force of CCP government. Yeah, tartar government force, not free choice of man and woman. There is no freedom at all here.

101,"I'm not the person you're asking, and I'm definitely not a supporter of Trump. So, I'm not defending the position, just acknowledging why people think that way. And it seems to be a position a lot of people take. Most people don't really care what the government is doing until it affects them. Most of Trump's terrible decisions and completely inept people he's put into positions of power, simply because they were fawning sycophants who praised Trump whenever they could, haven't impacted most people.

The economy has mostly been doing okay, not because of anything Trump did, but he hasn't screwed it up. We aren't engaged in any major wars, the wars in the middle east continue, but on a smaller scale that doesn't affect most people. Things could be better in many aspects, but for most people things aren't remarkably worse than they were under Obama. The coronavirus is the first major crisis (that it didn't create) this administration has had to deal with, and it seems to be a very large crisis. It's easy to diffuse a situation that you created, dealing with one you didn't make takes actual good governance and leadership, which this administration lacks.

So, the inadequacies of this administration are now on full display. This is a situation Trump can't call a hoax or lie about and make up a funny name for it on twitter and it will go away. His need to talk things up and make things seem better than they are is sending mixed messages and creating uncertainty. Uncertainty creates a lot of apprehension, and that makes things even worse. Now, the failings of the administration are apparent to everyone and affecting the average person's life. Can I still travel? Can I still go to work? Can my kids still go to school? How will I get my daily necessities if things close? How is this affecting my retirement account? Can I still do any of the things I enjoy (watch sports, go to concerts, movies, restaurants, etc)?

Also, do you personally wear mask every time when there's an influence season? Why not? Many other seasonal flues are extremely more common and they too can kill the weak and old. It's not like the coronavirus is some sort of supervirus. It's classified to be like ""kind of"" contagious and has relatively low fatality. Unpleasant? Sure.

104,"Self-ID became popular among activists in the west as a result of failings in trans psychiatric healthcare in the 2000s and early 2010s, which often forced (and in many cases, continues to force) trans people to jump through arbitrary and often stereotyped-based hoops, usually involving hyperconformity to gender presentation stereotypes, rather than actually assessing dysphoria by international psychological standards. By allowing psychologists with poor backgrounds on the subject authority over legal gatekeeping, - a result of the ""wild west""-style culture of transgender healthcare that emerged due to demand appearing at a rate that outpaced education - trans people were placed in the absurd position of having to appease these standards in order to obtain the legal recognition needed to live an ordinary life.

For example, when I transitioned as a teenager, among the things I was criticized for when pursuing a gender dysphoria diagnosis partially under the NHS, which again is the first thing you need to achieve legal recognition of any sort under the current system, were: not having learned makeup good enough, not wearing a skirt, not speaking with a sufficiently feminine affect, not displaying enough overt enthusiasm about having developed breasts, not ""smiling enough"", not having a nice enough haircut, not having animated enough mannerisms, not having been penetrated in anal sex, not going a sufficient amount of time without masturbating, not desiring children, not being unambiguously attracted to men, and not consuming enough feminine-targeted media. 

With the NHS showing very slow progress to improve in this respect and also being underfunded to the point that seeing a professional about gender dysphoria at all can now take up to 5 years (and because the presence of the NHS and the effect it has on the country's medical standards strangling most private alternatives that exist in places like the US), it is not surprising that many people sought a solution to legal recognition that divorced the process from psychological evaluation.

I would speculate the Tories embraced this option because it allowed them to appear to be improving trans peoples lot without spending any money fixing these fundamental problems. That they are now abandoning this with their recent populist bent is disappointing, but only insofar as it is disappointing to go from being served a lousy meal at a restaurant to being served no meal at all.

While obviously resources at present should be devoted to the coronavirus crisis, if in the long run the policy is abandoned without any substantial change away to repair the broken system that currently exists instead, then I expect rates of trans self-harm, suicide, and harm by misdiagnosis to only increase through the next decade in this country.",0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
105,"No, that is not correct. Allow me to explain. 

As you probably know, viruses can use either DNA or RNA as the alphabet in which they encode their genes - the whole of the genetic material is known as a genome. When viruses replicate, they also have to ""make copies"" of their genome. Coronaviruses use RNA. It's a well known fact that RNA viruses are genomically instable, meaning that their ""copying machines"" (enzymes known as RNA-dependant RNA-polymerase or RdRp) make frequent errors. Think of it as miss-spelling when you type at a keyboard. Each genetically different group of viruses is known as a genotype. There are already dozens of SARS-COV-2 genotypes around. Is this a problem? Let's see.

The immune system ""recognizes"" and attacks certain molecules, or fragment of molecules. These are known as antigens. But, what is the relationship between genotypes and antigens? Does a slightly different genotype necessarily lead to new antigens, that the immune system will not recognize anymore? Not at all. In fact, we must introduce the concept of SEROTYPE. A serotype is a strain of a pathogen that has different antigens. So, while there might be countless genotypes for RNA viruses, usually there is only one or a handful of serotypes. This is because our marvelous immune system will still recognize antigens even if they are a little bit different. 

Are there exceptions to this rule? Yes, there are. Some viruses are so variable, their copying machines are so faulty, that they can produce new serotypes more frequently than others. How frequently? Influenzaviruses produce new serotypes each year, around the world, hence having to cover for new, emerging serotypes with a yearly different vaccine. Then there are viruses like HIV or HCV whose copying machines are so unreliable, that they produce hundreds of different serotypes each day in each infected person. That is a primary reason why the immune system doesn't manage to get rid of them.

What about the common cold? The common cold can be caused by hundreds of different viruses, however the four common cold-causing Coronaviruses are actually quite stable. Coronaviruses on the whole are among the most stable RNA viruses. The reason why you can get reinfected multiple times is because of a different phenomenon, known as immunological amnesia. What this means is that after a little while your immune system simply forgets about these viruses. The reason is currently unknown, but it is suspected to be because they cause so little damage in such a localized area that a weak immune response is mounted, insufficient to evoke long-term immunity. 

What about COVID-19? We don't know. We don't know how long immunity would last. It has to be said, however, that in SARS, which was caused by a very similar virus, antibodies persisted for up to 3 years (but were faded by 6 years) while another kind of immunity (T-cell based immunity) was detectable 11 years after the disease. Authors argued that this would have been enough to prevent reinfection. We don't know if the same will be applicable to COVID-19, but they do are very similar.

 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26954467](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26954467) 

So, to sum it up: no, SARS-COV-2 is not ""ever-changing"" and this poses no problem to a possible vaccine. The real question is what to do if natural immunity is short-lived and we don't manage to obtain longer lenghts with vaccines: the answer is most likely boosters, i.e. periodically repeating vaccines. But there is no indication that we'd need to adjust the vaccine or anything like that. RNA viruses like polio or measles have been around for literally decades, circulating in hundreds of millions of people and accumulating innumerable mutations, but vaccines still work perfectly fine on them. Only influenza really needs adjustments.

106,"It's not about thinking, it's fact. It's how these things work. It's not complicated to understand. A virus is much like a wildfire. If you protect an area and shut down the fire and then do not prevent the fire from getting back it will come back if it's raging everyone else... or if you actually don't contain it and eliminate it then it will flair up again.

The only difference is that with the virus is that it won't kill 100%, unlike a fire which, if it burns the material it will generally do so to completion. It is actually worse than a fire.

Imagine a huge forest fire where the same material could be re-burned many times. Now, if immunity develops with the virus it will be like this but then one has to deal with mutations.

So, we will definitely see a huge increase and essentially it will be like wuhan 1.0.

&amp;#x200B;

In mathematics(or science in general) these are independent events. The virus doesn't know or care how many it as infected. It is called a memory-less process. 

So all it will take is ONE person infected to ignite the fire again. Now, again, it's not 100% because there are many factors involved. Immunity, vaccines(not yet), awareness, drugs that help, etc...

There is about a 99% chance that we will see them reinfected, assuming they will report it. The slave masters, though, do not care about the slaves... just the $$$.  They want to get people back to work ASAP. At most some will die and many will get sick but they will recover, but there will be at least some people working. That is how most western governments are approaching it to avoid the economic damage. They will accept some dead, as long as many are working they are ok with it.

&amp;#x200B;

For example, you can quarantine 100% of the population for 6months and have 0% economic progress(this could be a major logistics problem but governments are suppose to have prepared for such events). Essentially push the hold button and go in to maximal shutdown to preserve society(take the economic hit but save many).

Or you can ignore the problem 100%. What happens is some people will become sick, say 20%, some will die, say 5%. But you still have 75% of the population working which will eventually increase back to 95%... still making that $$$. The governments and corps could give a rats ass about the dead. Hell, they might give a check to the families to make them shut up(which the families end up having to work extra to pay back(nice trick)). They might say ""We will ""absorb"" the cost of the burials and give you 1k$ for any ""inconvenience"" and then you will see taxes slowly increase.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, this also has many factors. If one can be reinfected then the death rate will clime to 100% over time. If the death rate is 10% and the sick cannot return to work then you lost 30% of the workforce. If there are multiple strains then you won't be able to stop people from getting sick and the death rate will climb to 100%. Sick, sick, dead... or sick, dead, or sick sick sick sick dead.

&amp;#x200B;

107,"I did not claim to be psychic, but pretty much if you study any infectious disease's history, the tendency (and I'm specifically referring to the tendency here) is for a virus to do one of two things:

a) Evolve over time to be less likely to kill a host.  (This has happened *provably* for H1N1 flu, has also shown strong evidence of happening for multiple other diseases including measles, and there's strong evidence this has occurred in past with human coronaviruses. 

b) Burn out because it runs out of hosts, quite possibly because it's TOO good at killing its hosts or it fails to propagate.  (Ebola--though it's showing trends at ""taming down""; Sin Nombre hantavirus; the Black Death; whatever caused the Plague of Athens historically that Thuciclydes described, whether it was filoviral or possibly some other disease; the Picardy Sweat; many other diseases historically).

Even smallpox seems to have calmed down over time ([variola minor or alastrim becoming the dominant form of smallpox in the US and Commonwealth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alastrim) in the earliest 20th Century and eventually becoming the last form of smallpox in the wild before it was wiped out in the mid-seventies--it's actually theorized alastrim NOT killing most of its patients (around a ""bad flu year"" 2% death rate versus the usual 20-30% for variola major in non-naive populations and closer to 60-90% mortality in naive populations) gave it a significant survival advantage).

I seriously, SERIOUSLY doubt that somehow COVID-19 is going to be the Grand Exception to a trend that has occurred with human viruses (and for that matter, human infectious diseases in general) of remaining both ""super-infectious and super-deadly"".  If (or more properly, the odds are likely to be *when*, not if--but we'll be diplomatic and say ""if"") a mutation occurs that makes COVID-19 less likely to throw someone into full-blown pneumonia but still allows it to survive (and in fact may make it more transmissible, because people won't be pretty much ready to go into the hospital)...THAT variation is likely to have a survival advantage, simply because people will treat it more like a bad chest cold than SARS 2.0.  This is simple, pure Occam's Razor here.

Viruses that kill people tend to be very aggressively treated by humans and quarantined and treated as Bad Things, which (even aside from the fact that a virus can't reproduce well in a host if it kills the host in the process) does not exactly help the long-term survival of the virus as a disease.  

(Put more bluntly: People passed alastrim more than ""classical smallpox"" in the early 20th century because alastrim typically didn't have close to a 1 in 3 chance of killing you and had milder symptoms--you didn't go into the classical ""pocks"" as much, you were still well enough to move around and do things.  Smallpox, pretty much health departments were shutting down apartment buildings just like the Chinese government does with COVID-19 (and people *were* all but welded into their houses--more commonly, kept in their houses or sent to sanatoria by literal gunpoint if necessary) and doing mass ring immunization (again, occasionally by literal gunpoint) when smallpox was found--there was a distinct advantage for a Subtler Smallpox, even in crowded cities.)

You see, I'm *not* just counting the effects of ""random mutation in X population"" and ""does a milder virus have an easier time spreading in Chennai""--public health measures *in and of themselves* actually have to be considered as part of the natural history of an emerging infectious disease, and in cases where pretty much anyone showing obvious symptoms of ""classical COVID-19"" is likely to be subjected to quarantine...simple evolution *will* in time favour a ""COVID-19 descendant"" that is better adapted to the human body and less likely to throw one into the hospital, or the disease will *in time* burn itself out, either via running out of hosts (because everyone is immune and/or it's killed everyone potentially infectable) or running out of hosts (in that effective antivirals, prophylactics, and vaccines are widely available and pretty much Science The Fuck out of the existence of the disease).

(And honestly, the former scenario...COVID-19 eventually getting into ENOUGH of a symbiosis with humans over time that eventually humans will be immune enough--and the virus having acquired enough ""survive in humans without killing them"" beneficial mutations...is the most likely.  I won't lie in that the ""adaptation period"" is probably Not Going To Be Fun, but it's certainly NOT going to be a literal ""28 Days After""/""I Am Legend""/""The Stand"" type of Infectious Disease Apocalypse that wipes out most of humanity and throws us back to the Early Medieval Period. It's also unlikely at this point that it's going to completely burn itself out or be stamped out before it has the chance to evolve (thanks, PRC government :/). It's almost certainly NOT going to remain ""infectious or deadly"", though; the history of infectious diseases as long as humans have been documenting them show one or the other ultimately will give.)

I am also patiently (and without personal attacks, unlike yourself) asking again for your hypothesis on why H1N1 flus in humans and swine (both of which actually are traceable genetically and epidemiologically to the original late 1910s ""Spanish Flu"", a novel H1N1 influenza virus) are significantly less severe in their effects than the H1N1 flu from the late 1910s through at least the 1930s, despite world events (including World War II; the rise of megacities; mass human refugee crises; Europe having concentration camps that were literally breeding disease and the Soviet Union having gulags that were also plague factories because of the horrible conditions wherein; the rise of world travel, particularly travel by air and car; and the human population increasing by sixfold in general and reaching well over a billion people in China and India alone) that--by your stated hypothesis that diseases do not necessarily ""tame down"" in crowded conditions--should have resulted in preservation of something related to wild-type H1N1 (1918 serotype) that had equivalent morbidity and mortality to the original ""Spanish Flu"" serotypes.

(Again, not being facetious.  I'd honestly like to hear your explanation as to why people were not dropping dead en masse during World War II from the Spanish Flu 2.0.  Or why Vietnamese refugee camps weren't having 1918-esque morbidity and mortality rates.  Or why China didn't see similar rates, and why Woodstock wasn't the epicentre of an H1N1 pandemic of similar severity to the ""Spanish Flu"".  No matter what your theory is, I'm curious as to your explanation as to why we're not seeing Spanish Flu now, even in the more distinctly crowded parts of the world.)

(I'm also curious as to your explanation as to why there are definite changes in genetic markers in modern H1N1 flus versus H1N1(1918) specifically associated with morbidity and mortality--especially increased triggering of cytokine floods and *possibly* some neurological effects with H1N1(1918) versus modern H1N1 flus.  But first, I'm interested in your theory as to why we don't have a reservoir of the old-style ""infectious and deadly"" H1N1 flu a la WW I and mostly have to worry about ""swine flus"" descended from it.)",0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0
108,"&gt; # NUS, NTU students deliver meals to uni mates on leave of absence

&gt; Students at the National University of Singapore (NUS) and Nanyang Technological University (NTU) have started making daily food deliveries to their university mates at student lodgings who have been placed on a 14-day leave of absence due to recent travel to China.

&gt; The leave of absence - previously announced as part of measures to protect schools from the new coronavirus, which originated in Wuhan - is precautionary, while a quarantine order is much more stringent and has legal force with severe penalties for non-compliance.

&gt; The universities' food delivery initiative was lauded by National Development Minister Lawrence Wong in his ministerial statement in Parliament yesterday.

&gt; ""This is the Singapore Spirit which will enable us to prevail against the virus,"" said Mr Wong, who co-chairs the multi-ministry task force tackling the spread of the coronavirus.

&gt; The number of university students who are on leave of absence had not been released at press time.

&gt; At Cinnamon College, the University Scholars Programme (USP) residential college, a group of 18 undergraduates have taken up food delivery duties since Monday last week.

&gt; NUS has four other residential colleges, seven student halls of residences and two student residences. It said that similar delivery services have been activated elsewhere.

&gt; The 18 students are residential assistants in Cinnamon College. On regular days, they help fellow students with residential matters and facilitate gatherings to help students bond.

&gt; NUS said the residential assistants can opt out of making deliveries at any time.

&gt; Mr Joash Tan, 25, a Year 4 USP student, is one of them. He told The Straits Times in an interview that they have been taking turns to make the food deliveries at 9am, 1pm and 6pm, with two students activated per meal.

&gt; It takes each duo about 30 minutes to complete the deliveries.

&gt; Each resident is already subscribed to a meal plan, which includes breakfast and dinner on weekdays, breakfast on Saturdays and dinner on Sundays.

&gt; Such meals are delivered every day to the affected students, while weekday lunches and other meals on weekends are also catered for and paid for by the university, said USP director Kang Hway Chuan, who is also a college master in Cinnamon College.

&gt; In total, there are about 600 residents in the college, most of whom are from the USP. There are also some exchange students.

&gt; Associate Professor Kang said that relevant safety precautions are taken, such as asking those on leave of absence to put on a mask when receiving meal deliveries in person.

&gt; Students making the deliveries have a standard operating procedure as well, such as donning masks and gloves at all times, and refraining from physical contact.

&gt; Prof Kang said: ""The students on leave of absence are not as high risk (as those serving quarantine orders), so these are just precautions we are taking.""

&gt; Mr Michael Ang, 22, who is also a residential assistant, said the team has also been delivering handwritten notes of support and concern from residents to those on leave of absence.

&gt; In addition, there is a Telegram chat group consisting of the residential assistants, residential fellows and students on leave of absence.

&gt; ""Because the students don't get much face-to-face interaction, we use the chat group to check in on them and drop them messages to let them know their meals have been delivered,"" said Mr Ang, a Year 2 USP student.

&gt; Yesterday, Education Minister Ong Ye Kung visited the government quarantine facilities at NTU's Graduate Hall 1 and NUS' Prince George's Park Residences.

&gt; He also visited students on leave of absence, met student volunteers helping out on campus, and joined them in delivering welfare packs and food packs.

&gt; Mr Ong said of students on leave of absence: ""They are healthy individuals who happened to have visited China in the last 14 days and fulfilling a social responsibility by isolating themselves as a precaution. They are part of our community, and we need to help and support them as best we can, instead of shunning them.""

&gt; The leave of absence was initially announced for those in Ministry of Education (MOE) kindergartens, primary and secondary schools, special education schools, junior colleges, polytechnics, Millennia Institute and the Institute of Technical Education.

&gt; The six autonomous universities agreed to implement the same protocol.

I also went on to point out that the US only added 1.06T in new wealth after taxes.  The money isn’t there to pay for this plan and he’s going to stagnant growth while putting us into a perpetual state of inflation.  You think people are broke now, just wait.

Additionally, you clearly don’t understand what his policy entails.  It may save some administration costs, but his plan will put millions of workers out of jobs.  It also doesn’t save the country any money.  Nearly every dime in savings from Medicare and Medicaid is fictional.  That cost directly rolls into his new plan.  Moreover, it also makes private health insurance illegal, unlike what is seen in the Nordic countries his bros like to tout, which have private insurance coverage nearing 25% now and still growing due to inadequate coverages and 30 day wait times for acute illnesses.

110,"Yes and no. I agree that they've been through SARS, so they should be hyper aware. For that the Chinese government is definitely in the wrong. There is no doubt about that.

However, SARS' infection rate was significantly lower than COVID-19. Not only was SARS harder to contract, it was also not contagious during the incubation period from what I understand. Therefore, my comment on not knowing it'll be this bad still stands.

Taiwan did a remarkable job in containing COVID-19 so far, and definitely should be commended for it. That is absolutely correct. Macau also recorded only 10 cases and had no new cases since early February, and that was without boarder closures (they are directly connected to Mainland China), although they did close all casinos. However, Taiwan's (and Singapore, Macau, etc) success should be compared to other countries. With China, it's not necessarily a fair comparison. Taiwan had more time to react.

No matter which country a disease initiated in, there had to be a period of time for the medical professionals and government to first form an opinion on the disease, then to figure out what level of action they need to take. Unfortunately, every disease is a little different, especially ones we have not seen before. Just like SARS is different from MERS and both are different from COVID-19.

For example, MERS, with its lower infection rate may not warrant the closure of cities and boarders even though the mortality rate is much higher.

Taiwan, and other places, if faced with being the initial country would also had to have taken the time to verify the issue before they could react while people keep getting infected at the epic center. And with world travel, it can still spread very quickly.

Therefore, comparing a non-patient-zero country to a patient-zero country is kind of like comparing apples and oranges. But again, I'm not saying things couldn't have been done a lot better in China in terms of taking it more seriously much earlier. But for a fair comparison we should be looking at Taiwan, Singapore and Macau vs Italy, UK, USA and Canada, for example.

I don't agree when you said ""it would be right if it happened in European countries"" though. SARS was widely known in terms of it's effects, so even those who did not experience it first hand should have the same alertness to it. Of course, that is unless they somehow thinks they are superior in some way and are not susceptible to ""Asian"" disease or some crazy non-sense.

You criticized China as being an authoritarian country and seem to believe this whole thing was due to her being one. However, considering the lack of response and planning of the many democratic countries like Italy, UK, the rest of EU, US and Canada, even when they had so much time to observe the entire thing go down in China, I highly doubt these countries would have done a very good job if in China's shoes.

I mean, even now our Canadian government is still telling us the risk is low and only CONSIDERING not letting certain high risk people in our country. And all that is after our stupid PM's wife caught the virus in UK.

If all of these non-authoritarian countries would have closed their boarders as soon as China decided to close off Wuhan, we may be all like Taiwan now, contained and happy. We'd only be dealing with stray cases of COVID-19 carriers who left China before the boarder closures. But no, they decided it was nothing. They decided the risk was low. They decided to put politics and the economy in front of the well-being of their citizens.

The issue may have started in China and their authoritarian government may have made bad choices, but the non-authoritarian countries had made horrible and even worse choices too before we get to where we are now.

Sure, one may say, ""oh, but the CCP pressured the WHO... Blah blah blah..."" We don't have evidence of that, but even if we do, it takes some ridiculous stupidity for these non-authoritarian countries to believe in this so called CCP-controlled-WHO that things are ok. It takes some serious negligence for these non-authoritarian countries to continue to treat it as low risk when China's action since the closure of Wuhan clearly says otherwise.

This whole ordeal has nothing to do with authoritarian vs democratic/non-authoritarian rule. It has to do with our governments (exclude Taiwan, Singapore and Macau) being incompetent, ignorant and arrogant. And unfortunately, this pandemic proved that stupidity in governments does not discriminate between the type of rule. Although so far, I see more inaction from democratic countries even after sufficient information was provided. (And if we don't believe in China's data, then the more we should have treated this seriously!)

The fact that we are dealing with a pandemic today is something EVERY GOVERNMENT (except Taiwan, Singapore and Macau) is to be blamed. China made some wrong moves initially, but it's the other countries' inaction that made it so much worse.

So, sure, keep yelling at CCP and be blind to the worse shortcomings of our own governments.",1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0

I'm an Italian economist.

2 questions related to coronavirus:

1. There might be a correlation btw pollution and coronavirus widespread? It seems those affected have already a partial damage in their pneumons since they live in areas with high pollution and high level of ozone.
Is it true that pollution remains anyway more dangerous for global health than this virus? It's reported by Stanford University that in China 72k people die in 2 months for pollution.

2. What about China BRI, Belt and Road Initiative from a global health perspective? From an article of reserchgate.net has been told :
""the current 5-year plan deviates from the previous 
12 strategic plans, which focused on domestic economic growth. The proposed Belt and Road Initiative will provide a channel through which China will facilitate its global 
health strategy, especially in the global south, through 
commercial, cultural, and personnel exchanges that will 
improve bilateral and multilateral regional cooperation.
With the rapid pace of globalisation, health 
problems are no longer issues for a single nation. 
Collective action by multiple countries are necessary 
to combat global health crises, such as infectious 
diseases, lifestyle risks, and health inequity, which all 
span beyond one’s sovereign border.""
Do we need to rely more on China in dealing with SDGG's - sustainable development global goals?

Thank you so much for devoting your time for dealing with these precious issues.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0

You can have the flu and corona at the same time. Test positive for the flu, and it will be assumed that that is what is causing your symptoms.   


A common diagnosis here in Fl has been Bronchitis. Another diagnosis would be pneumonia of unknown cause, and that is usually tracked but I haven’t been able to get numbers for January in the US.   


Blaming China is sort of silly. Pneumonia of unknown cause occurs all the time, so a few cases wouldn’t raise alarms. If someone had the flu at the same time, or some other condition, it would also be unlikely to raise alarms. It’s not like people were bleeding from their eyes or something.   


We have a huge pollen count in Florida right now, which causes sore throat, sneezing, breathing troubles. If you have a normally low body temperature, a 99.5 on a thermometer isn’t going to raise alarms. I tend to not run fevers, even when really sick. I had pneumonia with no fever until one day it went from low (97) to 104.   


It seems like people have this idea that the world operates on perfect knowledge, even though it obviously doesn’t. It would take a while to notice a trend, and then you have to identify the agent (is it environmental, bacterial, viral). Especially when the group getting ill is older people. Then you have to figure out if it’s contagious, and how contagious. 

&amp;#x200B;

It would be easy to first assume a food borne illness with so many patients from the same market- that wouldn’t generally pose a hazard to the world at large. It wasn’t only the exponential growth that made it clear, especially because most people don’t get sick enough to bring it to anyone’s attention. Look at the mayor of Miami- he’s basically fine. If he hadn’t been tested, he would assume allergies or a minor cold.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
113,"The 400.000 masks have arrived this monday evening from South Africa and they will be distributed in all the Regions, with priority given to the ones where the outbreaks are situated. The 309 tents used for triage have been set up in front of the hospitals. And then there are the 160 ventilators to be delivered to the ASL [local healthcare agencies] for intensive therapy, the over 70 buildings with a total of 6.656 beds that have been made available by the [Ministry of] Defense where to put the people who have been put into quarantine and cannot go home. The plan of the Civil Protection for the containment of the Coronavirus is operational. It provides for different intervention scenarios including the handling of eventual emergencies on ships, in order to avoid a repeat of what happend in Japan with thousand of people stuck on board [of the Diamond Princess cruise ship]. And it excludes the possible requisition of private properties or hotels, like it instead happens in case of natural calamities.

Facemasks for the Regions where the outbreaks are located.

In these past few day more than once it has been asked to supply [face]masks, in particular the ones with a filter, in order to “isolate” the positives and to limit the spread of the contagion. The commissar Angelo Borelli has put an order for the aquisition of 400 thousand masks and this morning their distribution will commence. “[the Region of] Lombaardy will be given priority and will recive the biggest supply, with 200 thousand masks”, explaines Luigi D’Angelo the responsible for logistics of the Civil Protection, who is managing the planification of interventions since the first positive cases of covid-19. And then 25.000 [masks] in Veneto, 20.000 in Piedmont, 20.000 in Liguria and 5.000 for all the other Regions.

Tents in front of the hospitals.

The 309 tents have instead been set up in front of the hospitals in order to avoid that the citizens enter the wards thus lowering the risk of cathing the virus, but also because its there where the first checks will be carried out. 100 [tents] have also been set up in the prisons. To the 735 policemen, carabinieri, finanzieri and soldiers already deployed to vigilate the “red zones”, 1.000 more volunteers will be added to make tests [for the virus], 500 of them will be sent to the airports. The “filter” inside the terminals has already allowed to check the temperature of 3 million and 400 thousand passengers: 1.500 of them were above the safety limit but none of them were positive to the virus [test].

Ships and barracks.

In order to handle the active control and quarantine not everybody can stay at home. Often the apartments are inadequate to avoid the contact between family members because there are non “isolated” rooms and services. Which is why it has been asked to the [Ministry of] Defense to make available its structers in every Region: 77 barracks that are now being used to host the asymptomatics and that – if the need arises – could be used to keep under control the patients with light symptoms. 2.189 rooms are available for a total of 6.656 beds. The Red Cross will be the one to manage them, handling the food, the cleaning and the assistance [of the patients]. If the sanitary situation were to further deteriorate and if there will be a lack of beds for the sick, then every Region has chosen an hospital that would be emptied of other patients in order to let in only those who have caught the virus.

Avoiding the spread in the ports.

The goal now is to avoid as much as possible the spread of the contagion, as well as panic. Thus every possible emergency scenario has been planned out. Amongst these there is the possible spread of the desease on a cruise ship. In order to avoid that all the tourists were forced to stay onboard with a high risk of getting sick, a series of ports that have the adequate structures to handle the recption and sorting of the passengers have been selected: [these ports are] Civitavecchia, Bari, Ancona and Ravenna. The procedure forsees that the passengers will undergo triage before landing and then they will be divided between asymptomatics headed for the barracks and symptomatics to instead be transferred to the hospitals. The families will not be split and foreign passengers will be immediatly be sent to their home country.

114,"Dominic Cummings has had a bad few weeks. After advertising for “weirdos and misfits” to shake up Downing Street, the first weirdo employed — a “superforecaster” — proved a bit too weird.

There had been his comments about race and IQ, preventing an “underclass” through mass contraception and — as journalists trawled deeper into Andrew Sabisky’s internet history — the brief foray into sex advice centred on the virtues of submissive wives.

And now, following the young special adviser’s inevitable resignation, reporters were at Mr Cummings’s house asking him about his employment policy. Was it all going well? His response? “Read Philip Tetlock's *Superforecasters*, instead of political pundits who don't know what they're talking about.”

A few days and hundreds of inquiries later and Tetlock, a Canadian academic, has been forced to draft a standard response to copy and paste into emails to journalist.

He is happy about the attention, and pleased people are interested in his work, but “it would be unfortunate”, he wrote, “if superforecasting came to be linked in the public mind with a political point of view”..

Indeed his life’s work, the promotion of a method for making better political and geopolitical forecasts, is ideology neutral — and, he says, definitely not to be associated with race science. “Contrary to recent rumours in UK,” he says, “there’s no sinister Nietzschean *Übermenschen* agenda.”

It has been, then, a busy week for Tetlock — not to mention a fraught one, as is any week in which you are forced to distance yourself from belief in a master race. Although, he says speaking to *The Times,* he was not as surprised as you might think to find himself invoked on the Islington doorstep of a Downing Street overlord.

In fact, he says, this is not even the first time a government official has referenced his research. Remember when Michael Gove said that “people in this country have had enough of experts”? That, he thinks, was him too.

Tetlock is best known for one fact. Over a decade ago he analysed 30,000 predictions made by hundreds of experts from television, print and radio — the “pundits” Cummings was referring to. His conclusion? Their accuracy is, quite literally, “no better than a chimp with a dartboard”.

Worse, the more eminent the expert the worse their results. The people we rely on to make predictions about the future are, in general, very bad at it indeed.

Tetlock is not only familiar with the case of Mr Sabisky. He is arguably the reason he was employed at all. Because if the first half of Tetlock’s career was about showing how bad most predictions are, the second was about making them better. Sabisky is the product of that and — forays into eugenics aside — Tetlock thinks Downing Street needs more people like him, rather than fewer.

“Whether you’re Tory or Labour, whether you’re Democrat or Republican, whatever your party affiliation and whatever modern democracy we’re talking about,” he says, “you should prefer that leaders are receiving predictions that are as accurate as possible.”

To do so, he argues, you need to employ the services — and methods — of superforecasters.

A “superforecaster” is not a title people give themselves. It is, like the science that created it, a precisely-defined concept. After learning that most experts are bad at predictions, Tetlock went on a hunt to find those who aren’t. Working with the US intelligence services, a series of global tournaments was launched, in which people — experts, pundits, schoolteachers, binmen — made predictions.

They answered questions including: “Will there be a London Bridge-scale terror attack in a European capital city in the next three months?” and “How many total cases of Wuhan coronavirus will have been reported by the World Health Organisation as of 20 March 2020?”

These are precise questions, to which clear answers are required. They are not afflicted by the curse of prediction that Tetlock identifies as “vague verbiage forecasting”, where assessments come in a form where it would be “very difficult after the outcome is known to assess who is closer to be right”.

When an expert, for instance, says Britain is going to “get Brexit done, and make a success of it”, it is difficult to see — barring utter catastrophe or an unprecedented boom — how the word “success” can ever be contradicted or affirmed. This kind of statement is perhaps defensible in politics. It should not be so, argues Tetlock, in political or intelligence advice.

“You have experts making claims along the lines of, ‘there's a distinct possibility that the Iranian nuclear programme will successfully produce an atomic bomb by the end of 2021’,” he says. “What does ‘distinct possibility’ mean in that context? It could mean anything between roughly 20 to 80 per cent, depending on whether you're focused on ‘distinct’ or ‘possibility’.”

This matters. “The semantic elasticity of the forecast protects the forecaster from falsification, and that slows down the learning process and makes it much harder, for both experts and the people who consume expertise, to evaluate who was closer to the truth on what.”

Worse, he suspects the sensible analyst might even deliberately skew their answers. “As a reasonably career-savvy analyst there are two mistakes here. You could underestimate the likelihood of getting a bomb or overestimate.”

You could be wrong, in other words, because Tel Aviv gets nuked and you thought it wouldn’t, or wrong because nothing happens and you suggested it might. “Which mistake would be worse for my career? That is the calculus that goes on inside every organisation all the time and that's a problem with the traditional civil service model.”

In the forecasting tournaments, that is not possible. When people make an assessment, they have to put a number to it. Then, their accuracy is judged. And when it was, of all the thousands of entrants, Sabisky fell in the top 2 per cent and within a category termed “superforecasters”. Then, he was employed by Mr Cummings to advise on defence, on questions such as whether Iran would get a bomb.

Superforecasters are all different, but they also share traits. To do well in the tournaments you can have an ideology but Tetlock, who works at the University of Pennsylvania, has found you must put it aside when assessing facts. You must be aware of, and avoid, common cognitive biases.

For instance, in the wake of a London Bridge terror attack you might guess a higher chance of another happening. A superforecaster would instead look at the base frequency of terror attacks going back five years and start with that. Then by reading around the subject, but not too much — most are at the level of “informed *New York Times* readers” — he or she would come up with a probability figure.

These are, says Tetlock, exactly the qualities needed in Downing Street. “The UK is in an interesting situation, post Brexit. There's a lot of pressure on the leadership to be resourceful. So I think it's understandable they should want to look to improve the quality of the decision-making process. I can't help but admire government officials who show an interest in rethinking how probability estimates flow into the policy process.”

Eventually, he says, this idea of using probabilities and keeping score will not seem niche nor even controversial — but obvious. Then, a century or so in the future, with the “crushing condescension of history” we will look back on the way we made decisions in 2020 with the scorn we reserve today for the Salem witch trials.

So, in the main, he is pleased that earlier this week the government’s chief adviser took time out while stepping past his wheelie bin to recommend his book. Although he adds, given what prompted it: “I would probably have rathered I had come up in a different context.”",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0

These bonds are held by an assortment of investors, but rags like the WSJ and FT are only reporting on banks’ exposure to the shale producers via direct equity, not bond holdings.

As of 2020, the coronavirus family includes 40 types of viruses. The most popular of which, at least among people, was the [2019-nCoV virus](https://yandex.com/turbo?parent-reqid=1584067794292708-244623112302846481100079-sas4-3023&amp;utm_source=turbo_turbo&amp;text=https%3A//medicina.dobro-est.com/koronavirus-2019-ncov-simptomyi-lechenie-profilaktika.html) (Wuhan coronavirus, Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus) [newly detected](https://yandex.com/turbo?parent-reqid=1584067794292708-244623112302846481100079-sas4-3023&amp;utm_source=turbo_turbo&amp;text=https%3A//medicina.dobro-est.com/koronavirus-2019-ncov-simptomyi-lechenie-profilaktika.html) in late 2019 in Wuhan (China).

The main targets of coronaviruses in the body are the respiratory and nervous systems, the gastrointestinal tract (GIT), as well as epithelial cells with macrophages. However, as in the case of 2019-nCoV, most types of coronaviruses primarily affect the respiratory system, which at critical times leads to the development of SARS, which in the absence of adequate and timely therapy can lead to death of the patient.

The culprits are - HCoV NL63, HCoV 229E.

Coronavirus was first detected in relatively recent 1965, when examining a patient with signs of [acute respiratory viral infection (ARVI)](https://yandex.com/turbo?parent-reqid=1584067794292708-244623112302846481100079-sas4-3023&amp;utm_source=turbo_turbo&amp;text=https%3A//medicina.dobro-est.com/orvi-opisanie-simptomyi-prichinyi-lechenie-i-profilaktika-orvi.html) . Since that time, similar types of viruses have been identified that have been shown not only in humans but also in animals.

The course of acute respiratory viral infections caused by coronaviruses in the vast majority had a mild and moderate course and did not threaten the life of living organisms. But this was until 2002, when the world was alarmed by repeated deaths from complications of SARS. As it turned out, the causative agent was a new type of coronavirus - SARS (SARS-CoV, Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus). SARS-CoV provoked the development of a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS, SARS, purple death). Infection caused destruction of lung alveoli cells, which led to mortality in 9% with SARS.

The next step in the promotion of Coronaviridae was MERS (MERS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome), which causes Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS), which also recorded many deaths.

And so 2019–2020, COVID-19 was discovered, which at the beginning of the outbreak was called “2019-nCoV,” or the so-called Chinese coronavirus (Wuhan), from which as of 02/11/2020, 170 people have already died.

**What is interesting about these three types of viruses?** All 3 were first recorded in China, bats and partially, snakes, are considered the reservoir of all three. It is these representatives of the animal world that calmly enter the diet of many residents of the East.

Most people become infected only with the first signs of the disease. However, according to various scientists and medical workers, the 2019-nCoV newly detected in China is distributed even during the incubation period, i.e. a person becomes contagious even before he has symptoms.

*Most of the infected patients were men (30 \[73%\] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 \[32%\]), including diabetes (eight \[20%\]), hypertension (six \[15%\]), and cardiovascular disease (six \[15%\]). Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0-58·0). 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market. One family cluster was found. Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 \[98%\] of 41 patients), cough (31 \[76%\]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 \[44%\]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 \[28%\] of 39), headache (three \[8%\] of 38), haemoptysis (two \[5%\] of 39), and diarrhoea (one \[3%\] of 38). Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days \[IQR 5·0-13·0\]). 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia. All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT. Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 \[29%\]), RNAaemia (six \[15%\]), acute cardiac injury (five \[12%\]) and secondary infection (four \[10%\]). 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died. Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNFα. Interpretation: The 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality. Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.*

The antigens are extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of Immunology most of the jokes will go over the average redditors head. There's also Corona's respiratory outlook, which is deftly woven into its prognosis - it's personal philosophy draws heavily from SARS and MERS's infections, for instance. The ssRNA understands this stuff, they have the replicatory capacity to truly reproduce these viruses, to realise they're not just funny- they say something about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike nCoV-2019 truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in patent zero's existential catchphrase- ""I can't breathe"" which itself is a cryptic reference to the Viruses symptoms, drowning in your own mucus- I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Corona's genius unfolds itself on their vitals screen.

124,"Hello everybody, I'm new to Reddit this is my first ever post. Btw I'm very sorry about the inconvient timing of this post given  the strange and tragic circumstances right now with Covid19. 
Anyway you guys seem to be nicer and less complex than other forums so here it goes :
I'm 30 years old, female, fit and physically healthy , attrctive by some standards and despite depression and anxiety prone i am mature, strong minded, smart and compassionate
I recently (and it wasnt planned it just sort of ..happened by itself) decided i was going to be open to dating and finding love again. I really would at least i think i would, like to but because of my sporadic and limited experience I'm not really fully sure how or what the right way to go about it is..

A bit of background: I have dated people but its always been short term, a month if that and at the time I didnt even know what I was doing , they weren't official or serious and treated several of them badly by ghosting or getting irritable and parranoid when I get triggered.  Once I realised it made me feel awful and I have with mixed results gone back several times to some of these people to apologise, say sorry  , try again or just yo yo until i end up blocking not always for good reasons. I have put those old habits behind me but I still need some help with the thinking part.

I lost my virginity to a narcissistic individual age 27/28 who I was very attracted to physically and intellectially but he didnt deal well with my mood swings and insecurities and when i was struggling he didnt treat me well so after a very turbulent year i eventually managed to leave, cut short 2 years after on off on off I still tried to forget him. I'm happy to say now i finally have omitted him from my life and all but see reality :)

After that I went the opposite way..i dated my long term best friend online briefly, didnt sleep together its only ever been the narcissist whose had proper sex with me. its a significant detail. i turned my friend down too, i couldnt do it. Also he was total opposite im every way to the narcissist , looks , height, personality , intensity hence being my friend, i found it difficult to be attracted to him so im wondering if that is a deal breaker for me? he treated me much better than my ex and never would have abused me intentionally like he did. 
But he had his own issues and kept saying he couldnt do it, could do it, couldnt, could on off until after i got home he talked himself until breaking up AGAIN so i said ""okay fine been nice knowing you"" i was still not completely over my ex at that point, yes i loved him my friend even tho i wasnt completely happy and i struggled with the attraction and us looking different. I'm slim n he was on the stocky side but..i dunno maybe he was TOO different to the ex to adjust, hes not someone i ever would have picked given a picture choice for instance. but maybe thats my ego talking? Im still not sure, but that was part of why i let him go and i thougjt it wouldnt be fair if he found me attractive and i didnt feel the same.

Since then theres been very little activity on the dating front, i dont flirt , I dont online date, i dont sleep or hook up with people friends or otherwise . It was just too painful to even consider  As my mental health got so extreme i regularly had migraines, palpitations, ruminating episodes, anger, suicidal thoughts, upset and confusion, back and forth behaviour with people and exes. I've struggled emotionally since I was a child . Its been very hard and sometimes I thought i would just despair and die

Anyway i'm doing a lot better now, I'm making a daily habit of self care, exercise , changing my thinkinghabits to not blow things out of control and makinc my friendships healthier and more balanced. I'm in therapy and actively working on myself and what my needs and wants are. It's a very slow work in progress but change is happening and I know that it all comes from me and I can't blame anybody else.
I joined a chatroom and am making some great friends there and slowly opening up to guys alongside having balanced friendships with awesome and helpful people. both men and women. It's a huge learning curve for me for sure! I've never been this balanced and progressive in my entire life
I'm just wondering what this means on the dating front because i already got talking to a handful of guys just to experiment, some are like no way, some i get reminded of my ex, some i question of my standards are too high, ie consider dating a non conventially atttractive person but then i still turn that around because of them as people not seeming right (this is teaching me what im.lookimg for and what im not!). I also still get triggered in varying degrees and im not sure how to handle that? 
I might not be ready still maybe im just learning about people and a balanced life in general.
is there any hope for people who are so prone to these issues? a part of me is so scared i will be even loosely bound to my past forever and never fully get past the initial stages. People are so complicated! it can be hugely disappointing and exhausting
God knows how i even wanted to even open up my heart again but thats humans for you! 

Sorry this was so long i just really wanted to vent before making mistake after mistake or some compromising situation falling for the wrong person
I really do need some help I think
thanks for reading and if anyone can help :)",0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0

A second university is offering Chinese students a financial incentiv­e to study this semester despite the coronavirus travel ban, as the federal government prepare­s to ease the ban enough to allow some students to enter Australi­a directly from China.

On Friday, the University of Adelaide emailed its 3000 or so Chinese students caught overseas by the ban offering a “care package” worth about $5000 — a 20 per cent discount on first-­semester tuition fees plus airfare support of up to $2000, which they will be eligible for once the travel ban is lifted.

Acting on medical advice, the government is planning to allow about 1000 Chinese research stud­ents to enter directly from China in a week’s time. After that it will consider allowin­g other groups of Chinese students to fly directly to Australia, although it is not clear how the groups will be selected.

The plan to ease the ban is based on [expert advice ](https://www.health.gov.au/news/australian-health-protection-principal-committee-ahppc-recommendation-on-travel-restrictions-and-coronavirus-covid-19)to the government which said it can consider relaxing restrictions from February 29 if coronavirus case numbers in China, outside Hubei province, do not show a “material increase”.

The government’s official expert group, the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee, also said that if epidemiological indicators remained as they were, the entry of Chinese students “would not materially increase the current low risk of importation of cases from mainland China (outside of Hubei province)”.

Meanwhile, increasing numbers of Chinese students are beating the travel ban by travelling to third countries, where they must spend a 14-day quarantine period before entering Australia.

Ben, a student enrolled at RMIT who did not want to give his full name, said he planned to fly to Australia on February 23. He said he was not confident of getting in, “but I must take the risk”.

Melbourne education consultant Gary Li, who is in Bangkok to assist Chinese students transiting to Australia, said his students did not regret choosing the third-country option because they don’t know how long the travel ban will be in force.

The Group of Eight univer­sities, where most of the 100,000 Chinese students caught by the ban are enrolled, said it wanted its students back on campus as soon as possible. Go8 chief executive Vicki Thomson said the group appreciated and welcomed the government considering the medical advice. “We will explore all options to see what can be achieved with government support,” she said.

But Ian Jacobs, vice-chancellor of Go8 university UNSW, warned against a “piecemeal relaxation” of the travel ban. “I’m sure that any relaxation would be well-intentioned but it could end up causing confusion and even more anxiety, and be very difficult to imple­ment,” he said.

The Australian Health Protection Principal Committee said in its advice to the government that students entering directly from China would “need to agree to self-isolation in Australia” and universities would need to support that.

The committee is made up of the state and territory chief health officers and is chaired by Australia’s Chief Medical Officer, Brendan Murphy. In its statement, the committee also revealed that the China travel ban could be relaxed for a small number of other cases, including Year 11 and 12 school stud­ents, as long as they were not from Hubei province.

Western Sydney University this week offered its stranded Chinese students $1500 towards the cost of beating the travel ban by transiting a third country but the University of Adelaide is not encouraging that option.

But it is offering each of its stranded Chinese students a personalised study plan and will allow them to study online until June 1, when they need to be on campus to complete first semester face-to-face. The university will give late-arriving Chinese students inten­sive tutorials to help them complete their studies on time.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0
126,"University of Washington's statement to faculty is from the school of psychology. Can't make this shit up. They mention feelings more than hygiene

&gt; As you may have heard, today public health officials announced that the first death in the United States attributed to the novel coronavirus has occurred in King County. While this individual was not a UW student or employee, our hearts are with his family and friends during this time of tremendous loss. They’re also with those who have been affected by this outbreak directly, including through the impact on their loved ones, and through heightened anxiety and fear, discriminatory experiences or economic loss.

It is important to emphasize that thus far the vast majority of people who have become ill with COVID-19 (the disease caused by the novel coronavirus) have experienced relatively mild symptoms, such as fever and cough. As of this writing, fewer than 10 individuals in Washington have been diagnosed with this disease. One of them has already recovered and returned to a normal life, and we expect others will follow. Currently, no members of the UW community have been diagnosed with COVID-19.

I write today to ensure you are aware of how the University is working with public health officials to be as prepared as possible to protect the health of the UW community.

We are extremely fortunate to live in a region with outstanding medical services and public health infrastructure and are optimistic that these significant investments in public health preparedness will support a rapid, effective response. At the UW, we are working closely with local and state public health officials and following guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to align our plans with the most current recommendations from experts. This includes encouraging everyone to monitor their own health, practice good hygiene and stay home if feeling sick.

University preparations
The University has extensive and thorough emergency procedures, and will do everything it can to ensure the health and safety of our community.

Out of an abundance of caution, we are making the same types of preparations that we would for any other potentially disruptive situation, such as a natural disaster. This includes working with campus leadership and regional public health partners to help colleges, schools and departments take steps that can minimize disruptions to student learning, such as assessing their readiness to conduct class activities online, should that be required, and ensuring students and employees who are ill can be properly supported so they can stay home and recover. We are also making similar preparations related to maintaining our vital research, service and patient care missions in the event of a disruption. Further guidance for staff, faculty and other academic personnel will be forthcoming.

Even if these measures are not ultimately needed, ensuring we are prepared for disruptions now will serve us well in the future.

What you can do
Many people are asking what they can do. Community preparation helps us support and care for each other. Here are actions you can take to help us all stay as healthy as possible:

Stay informed
Refer to and share the UW’s coronavirus FAQ page, which is developed in close consultation with public health officials and includes information about considerations for travel, steps to take if you feel sick and resources for UW community members. There are also updates available from the Washington State Department of Health and county public health departments.

Practice good hygiene

Stay home from work and school when you feel sick.

Cover your mouth and nose with your elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze, and immediately dispose of the tissue.

Wash your hands often with soap and water, for at least 20 seconds, and if soap and water are not available use a 60-95% alcohol-based hand sanitizer.

Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth.

Clean and disinfect surfaces that are frequently touched.


Remain calm and show compassion
Data on COVID-19 is still emerging, and the Washington State Department of Health is reporting that while the immediate health risk from COVID-19 has increased with the newly diagnosed cases in our region, for the general public it still remains low. And as a reminder, the vast majority of individuals with the disease experience mild symptoms.

Additionally, it is vital that we support each other and act as a community, avoiding acts of discrimination and bias, and showing compassion for those affected by this disease. This virus poses a global challenge — it requires a unified response.

128,"**With this new coronavirus outbreak, working from home is no longer a privilege, it’s a necessity.**

The sanitary risk of a 2019-nCoV outbreak in New York City is an opportunity for most companies to test working from home at scale.

Apart from contributing to a healthier environment, helping employers and employees save money on transportation and office space, and promoting equal opportunities in the employment market, working from home might be the most efficient containment measure each individual could take part of.

Of course, working from home is not ideal, it's a skill, it takes time to acquire, both for employees and employers. It’s going to mean a lot of video chats and phone calls, but many tools are already available for a reasonable price: Slack, Zoom, Yammer, Dropbox, Google Drive.... and or course VPN tools to improve cybersecurity. 

Yes, some jobs are not really adapted. Retail industry for example, but most importantly some critical services like power generation, grid services, communications, and food production. However, those services only require a small percentage of the population to maintain in the modern days.

Focusing first on tech companies, advertising firms, and financial institutions would make sense. A growing number of US companies are already working as fully distributed teams. More [recently](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-business/firms-in-china-extend-holidays-ask-staff-to-work-from-home-as-virus-spreads-idUSKBN1ZQ0BO), some Chinese corporate giants including Alibaba Group and Tencent have asked staff to work from home for one week after an extended Lunar New Year break ends, seeking to limit the spread of the 2019-nCoV virus.

A 2015 study from [Stanford University](https://nbloom.people.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj4746/f/wfh.pdf) in California found that productivity among employees at a Chinese travel agency went up by 13% when they worked from home due to fewer breaks and more comfortable work environments.

Working from home seems to result in higher productivity, help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution, commute congestion, and most importantly would be an efficient measure to contain a possible rapid outbreak of the 2019-nCoV virus in densely populated cities such as New York City.

They were already coming back under Obama and most of those jobs were lost to Bush's economic recession. 

As a matter of fact, in Obama's last 3 years he added over 8 million jobs to the economy while Trump has added less than 7 million in his first 3 years. So job growth has actually slowed under Trump.  [https://www.forbes.com/sites/chuckjones/2020/02/07/obamas-last-three-years-of-job-growth-all-beat-trumps-best-year/#7917ab5c6ba6](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chuckjones/2020/02/07/obamas-last-three-years-of-job-growth-all-beat-trumps-best-year/#7917ab5c6ba6) 

This is even in the face of the fact that Trump blew a hole in the deficit just to get his inferior job numbers.

&gt;Lowered taxes for all Americans, who then used the money to better the economy.

GDP growth has remained relatively stagnant under Trump, with him not achieving annual GDP growth of 3%. So your claim that his tax cuts improved the economy have no merit. 

&gt;He somehow won the trade war with China, which i didn't even agree with.

No he didn't and the article in the following comment that you linked only said that China reduced its retaliation tariffs by half, not that they lowered existing tariffs or lost the trade war. As a matter of fact, China's decision to reduce its retaliation tariffs was only made AFTER Trump decided to cut his tariffs in half, which is explained in your own article. 

&gt;He got us out of NAFTA.

There's no evidence this improved the stock market. Stock's actually remained relatively the same after the announcement and the creation of the USMCA.

&gt;You're turn. How is he responsible for this drop?

So none of your sources or examples actually substantiate that Trump's policies increased the stock market. 

In regards to this stock market drop, it's quite possible that if Trump retained a better relationship with China, then China would have been willing to work more honestly and directly with the U.S. in trying to contain the outbreak, instead of lying about it. This could have allowed us and the rest of the world to be better prepared for the outbreak. 

A whistle-blower details how federal health workers were improperly trained by Trump's administration before coming into contact with people being monitored for the coronavirus. This leads to increased fears that Trump's government has no idea what they're doing and is just more evidence of his overall ineptitude.  [https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelsandler/2020/02/27/whistleblower-complaint-us-health-workers-helped-coronavirus-patients-without-protective-gear-training/#5bb7c3977e6e](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelsandler/2020/02/27/whistleblower-complaint-us-health-workers-helped-coronavirus-patients-without-protective-gear-training/#5bb7c3977e6e) 

Trump has lied about China's ability to contain the virus which also spreads fear and uncertainty with global markets. So now that we see that they are clearly not contained, Trump's ability to quell market fears is certainly hampered. 

These are some things Trump did reducing our security and ability to deal with virus outbreaks:

* Shutting down the entire global-health-security unit of the National Security Council.
* Eliminating the US government's $30 million Complex Crises Fund.
* Reducing national health spending by $15 billion.
* Consistently attacking Mark Green, the director of the US Agency for International Development.

132,"I'm as anti-McConnell/GOP as it gets, but as far as the straight numbers go, I don't think their 600/1200 (+500 per kid) stimulus checks are **completely** ludicrous (key word, ""completely""). People over 75k must have a savings account unless you've spent all your god damn money on stupid crap outside of your budget; the 30-75k adults with families are going to get hit the hardest, because the health care bills, rent or mortgage, car bills, etc. add up.

If you're in that bracket between your wife (1200 each) and your kid (500), you will be eligible for $2900 which is quite a lot of money for a relief fund. If you're a single young adult who made little to no money in 2018 due to schooling or health issues or some other case, but now have a good job and raised living expenses, which there will be many of these exceptions, they need to make provisions to help these people.

The thing is , people in the lowest income bracket already are eligible for things like medicaid, food stamps and welfare. They need to get these checks out right now and be prepared for more in the next 2 months. Meanwhile, what they should be doing is freezing all student loans, putting health care measures in place so that people aren't left with $10k bills from getting an ICU treatment from Corona, and getting more food banks and stamps ready for the unemployed service sector.

This system was so fragile and f\*\*\*ed. I'm all for single-payer health and taxing more for infrastructure, but the way the US economy and government are setup, it's impulsive to pass a gigantic unemployment package for every citizen while the US Dollar is actually at risk of hyper inflating.

I live in a city so I know our expenses are higher, but as far as a federal help, the 600/1200/0 is in the ball-park. At the state and city levels, governments can offer more assistance and programs for expensive places like Bay Area, NYC, etc. What's the largest group that this 2018 Tax bill will affect? The fresh college graduates. I'm not saying it's a fair situation, but if you had to make a choice, then the 21-24yo population who had no job in 2018 but now has been working should absolutely be fine with a $600 bailout unless they decided to live WAY beyond their means - freeze the student loans, and as this crisis deepens, consider freezing rent/mortgage/auto-loans and health care payments. But not everybody needs a massive check right now.

I know there's gonna be some bull shit fine-print in this bill, but they need to pass this quick, and I think arguing semantics about these checks is the last thing they should fight about. I'm a democrat and actually an AOC fan, but I hope they don't bog this debate down and demand $3000+ per every American household sitting at home not doing anything, cause IMO that is bat shit crazy right now. You can keep printing money, but at the end of the day, the hard bills need to be fought to a halt like the Corona virus itself.

Iran has an open border with China so it's no surprise they got hit like a sack of bricks. Japan's handling it worse and data's not exactly forthcoming. I want to pick out what Trump could do better but I'm at a loss of *useful* ideas. There's no real treatment, there's no prevention, this is spreading too fast to contain or even test with accurate numbers.

Frequent testing obviously could have done, and still fucking should, but isolating anyone coming from a country that had been in a country that China flies to for weeks isn't exactly a viable option.

Those numbers do not rime with the 2% death rate everyone is talking about. You can bet your ass almost everyone on the DP has been contaminated with corona. However, 80% did not get sick, and their immune system fought it off before it could make them sick. If 7 out of 3700 died, we’re looking at a death rate of ~0,02%.

The DP has been the perfect study case, as you can not miss to test a single person in this small, fully contaminated, environment.

The problem with real world numbers, is that we do not know how many people have been contaminated with covid-19 and only have very mild or no symptoms at all. Many people who wear the virus, will never get tested.

That doesn’t mean there is no reason for caution for people at risk, but the panic and hysteria has to stop. It’s a new virus, that what’s makes it more lethal than influenza, as most of us have antibodies against influenza from the first time we got sick with that virus. Our immune system hasn’t learned to battle corona yet, and that’s why we see elderly people, with poor immune systems, getting hit the hardest. If corona becomes seasonal, we will see the death rate drop a lot.

In one way we think a great deal too much of the atomic bomb. “How are we to live in an atomic age?” I am tempted to reply: “Why, as you would have lived in the sixteenth century when the plague visited London almost every year, or as you would have lived in a Viking age when raiders from Scandinavia might land and cut your throat any night; or indeed, as you are already living in an age of cancer, an age of syphilis, an age of paralysis, an age of air raids, an age of railway accidents, an age of motor accidents.”

In other words, do not let us begin by exaggerating the novelty of our situation. Believe me, dear sir or madam, you and all whom you love were already sentenced to death before the atomic bomb was invented: and quite a high percentage of us were going to die in unpleasant ways. We had, indeed, one very great advantage over our ancestors—anesthetics; but we have that still. It is perfectly ridiculous to go about whimpering and drawing long faces because the scientists have added one more chance of painful and premature death to a world which already bristled with such chances and in which death itself was not a chance at all, but a certainty.

This is the first point to be made: and the first action to be taken is to pull ourselves together. If we are all going to be destroyed by an atomic bomb, let that bomb when it comes find us doing sensible and human things—praying, working, teaching, reading, listening to music, bathing the children, playing tennis, chatting to our friends over a pint and a game of darts—not huddled together like frightened sheep and thinking about bombs.

---------

Use of shared spaces if you live with others

Minimise the time you spend in shared spaces such as bathrooms, kitchens and sitting rooms as much as possible and keep shared spaces well ventilated.

Aim to keep 2 metres (3 steps) away from people you live with and sleep in a different bed where possible. If you can, use a separate bathroom from the rest of the household. Make sure you use separate towels from other people in your house, both for drying yourself after bathing or showering and for hand-hygiene purposes. Ask your family or the people you live with to remember to use their own towels.

If you do share toilet and bathroom, it is important that you clean them after you have used them every time (for example, wiping surfaces you have come into contact with). Another tip is to consider drawing up a rota for bathing, with you using the facilities last, before thoroughly cleaning the bath, sink and toilet yourself.

If you share a kitchen with others, avoid using it while others are present. Take your meals back to your room to eat. If you have one, use a dishwasher to clean and dry your used crockery and cutlery. If this is not possible, wash them using your usual washing up liquid and warm water and dry them thoroughly, remembering to use a separate tea towel.

We understand that it will be difficult for some people to separate themselves from others at home. You should do your very best to follow this guidance and everyone in your household should regularly wash their hands, avoid touching their face and clean frequently touched surfaces.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
143,"&gt;I think it's more about the fact that people aren't aware of the racist bullshit asians have to deal with

Are they though? Almost all the messages on this post for example are saying how bad racism is, and it was obvious that some scum would use Corona Virus as an excuse. I think plenty of people are aware, partucularly if these kinds of stories are highlighted.

&gt;Not saying poster is condoning racism, it's just his comment takes away from people seeing the issue at hand

How? It's one joke in a sea of comments addressing the issue.

&gt;But yeah some ppl are just looking for excuses to be shitty human beings. Real scum.

144,"&gt;You eat animals. You don't care about animals. It doesn't matter if I know you. 

Flipside; Why is it okay to eat plantlife but not animal life? They are alive too, just because they don't move or make sounds makes them less important? Nothing lives without exploiting something else, it's simply how you do so that matters. 

&gt;How are we blind to the rest of the world? Are you making the (false) assumption that vegans are unaware of other issues? Or that the world is unable to address multiple issues? Or that people are able to have multiple concerns? This doesn't make sense. For clarity I've gone to a political rally in just the past week. I'm well aware of other issues.

In 90% if my interactions with Vegans (radical and not) yes, that is what I am saying. The majority cannot see beyond their quest to end consumption of meat, rarely think about how that would affect many peoples livelihoods, not to mention what would happen to the literal millions of cows/pigs/chickens/etc that exist solely for consumption? 


&gt;Rice and beans. Lasts forever and cheap as hell. It's much cheaper than meat (even canned). That's a pretty weak argument since rice and beans are cheap and plentiful all over the world. 

Oh my gods, shut up about rice and beans. Rice is not healthy, and not everyone likes or can even eat beans. You're complaining about how much land is used by farmers for their animals but how much land would you need to grow your massive supply of rice and beans? Same issue. 

&gt;Uh... It seems like you're almost getting it. You know it's wrong to take a life, but why isn't it wrong to eat their corpse? 


Gray area; It's not always wrong to take a life, extenuating circumstances are always a thing. 
Not to mention, if the animal is already dead what does it matter that it is eaten? Nature is as nature does. If people don't eat them something else will. That's how it is, circle of life and all that crap. 

&gt;People's continued unethical actions do not give me credence to act unethically. ""Two wrongs don't make a right."" Just because people will continue to litter doesn't mean I should throw my garbage on the sidewalk. 


That's not what I said. I didn't say you shouldn't continue advocating for animal welfare, but the fact is the regular person on the street has little power over the corporations that cause the actual problems. Education is key, but we currently live in an age where people do not want to be educated, and aside from tying them down and forcing your opinion on them that isn't going to change either.  You can advocate all you want, and do what works for you, but don't expect everyone else to follow. 

&gt;You don't see the big picture. If you could take the wool off your eyes you would begin to see. The leading cause of death in the world is heart disease from animal products. Animal agriculture is a significant contributor to climate change. It is the main driver to the habitat destruction and the extinction of species. Zoonotic diseases from animal consumption are a huge pandemic risk and we're in the midst of one right now from eating animals. The consumption of animal products lead to a litany of diseases and cancers that are entirely avoidable. Even if none of that was true, you would still be killing an innocent animal whose only crime to be killed for you to eat them was to exist. 


Heart disease does not only come from animal consumption, that's genetics. It does affect and worsen it, yes, but it is not the sole cause. Like sugar and diabetes, they correlate but one does not cause the other. 


Agreed on the Agriculture stance. 


They have yet to actually figure out where Covid-19 came from, right now it is still speculation. If it did come from the Chinese eating bats or pangolins, then good. Maybe it will save the endangered animals from being totally decimated by their uneducated way of thinking. 


Saying it again; Nothing can live without exploiting something else. There are always better ways to do so but it won't change that fact. 

&gt;You don't see the big picture and you don't get it. Vegans get upset and frustrated because it should be obvious to you. You don't even understand how many people don't give two shits and are going to keep hurting animals just like you. I doubt you'll see the light, but I hope you do.



I do understand. I see idiots cause senseless harm to animals, nature and other things everyday. 


But I'm not actively hurting animals. I am simply a consumer of a finished product. Again, cataclysmic event notwithstanding, there will never be enough people boycotting meat to make it stop.

Dear

I consider you part of our United family and your safety remains our highest priority.

We are in the business of serving people and in the midst of this coronavirus outbreak it's important that we give you as much flexibility as possible when planning your next trip. But it's also important that we give you as much information as possible about the procedures we follow to clean our aircraft and maintain a sanitary environment once we're in the air.

Our teams are in daily contact with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the World Health Organization (WHO), federal agencies and other global health organizations to share the most up-to-the-minute information to ensure the actions we're taking are comprehensive and appropriate.

So today, I wanted to personally reach out and share a few of the steps we are taking for you, our customer:

Before you fly
To give you the greatest flexibility, when you book any flight with us now through March 31, you can change it for free over the next 12 months – any ticket, any fare type, any destination.

On the ground
Our team of in-house medical experts and industrial hygienists oversee our aircraft cleaning procedures to ensure they meet or exceed all CDC guidelines. Hard surfaces such as lavatories, tray tables, window shades and armrests are thoroughly wiped down with a high-grade disinfectant and multi-purpose cleaner. And when we are advised by the CDC of a person who has traveled on board and is potentially exhibiting coronavirus symptoms, that aircraft is taken out of service and sent through a full decontamination process that includes our standard cleaning procedures plus washing ceilings and overhead bins and scrubbing the interior.

In the air
Our aircraft are equipped with state-of-the-art circulation systems, similar to those found in hospitals, which use a high-efficiency (HEPA) filter to circulate the air and remove more than 99% of airborne particles. We're also adjusting our inflight service to limit person-to-person contamination. This includes handing beverages directly to customers instead of allowing customers to touch a tray and ensuring all flight attendants wear gloves during service.

More information on each of these efforts can be found on the United Hub.

I know I speak for every member of our United family when I say that we take the greatest pride in the role we play in the lives of our customers, personally and professionally.

I want you to know that you can continue to rely on us. So, the next time we have the privilege of welcoming you aboard our aircraft, you can know our commitment to you remains as steadfast as ever.
 
Kind regards,

147,"# Schools and daycare centres closed - what does this mean for parents?

In order to contain the virus, several federal states are sending children to the ""Corona Holidays"". What rights do parents who have to work have? The most important answers.

**Are employees allowed to stay at home with their children when the daycare or school closes?**

Under certain conditions, this is possible for a short time, with continued pay. The basis for this is § 616 of the German Civil Code (""temporary prevention"").

Parents must have checked intensively beforehand whether there is another possibility of care. For this purpose, the upcoming weekend must also be used. A practical problem here could be that many families would like to call on grandparents in emergencies, but are currently advised against contact with grandchildren. Older people are at risk for the new coronavirus.

If no care at all is found quickly, employees are allowed to stay at home for a few days and continue to be paid wages. But it is important to note that this is by no means a permanent solution. In any case, you should inform your employer if you cannot come to work spontaneously - and check whether the rights of § 616 have perhaps been excluded in the employment or collective agreement. At least that is possible.

**And what can parents do in the long run?**

They should then examine various possibilities. Can I take paid leave? If that is not possible or if there are not enough holidays: Can I take unpaid leave? Or can I perhaps work from home?

Home office would of course mean actually working from home, possibly at more flexible times than in the office. All these things should definitely be discussed with the employer and amicable solutions sought.

**What applies to civil servants and public employees?**

There will also be solutions for emergencies, but a final answer is not yet possible at the moment. For federal civil servants there are rules on paid ""special leave"" for a few days. The wording does not fit exactly to a school closure, but could possibly be applied here.

For state officials, the individual states must now say whether similar rules exist locally. For employees in the public sector, there are rules in the collective agreement that could allow for short-term leave of absence due to school closures. Those affected should quickly obtain information from their employer.

**Can I take my child to work with me as an exception?**

That might be difficult. In any case, you have no right to it, it would only be possible in agreement with the employer. In the current situation, however, many bosses would certainly point out that social contacts should be avoided if possible.

Many of these questions were raised some time ago during the daycare strikes. The dimension of Corona, however, is quite different. There will be an enormous need for flexible solutions in childcare - with enormous challenges for parents and employers.

148,"Not absurd in anyway.  More and more scientists are coming to the same conclusion when they put the pieces together:

 A pre-print published by Botao Xiao and Lei Xiao, titled ""The possible origins of 2019-nCoV coronavirus"" whose abstract is the following...

The 2019-nCoV has caused an epidemic of 28,060 laboratory-confirmed infections in human including 564 deaths in China by February 6, 2020. Two descriptions of the virus published on Nature this week indicated that the genome sequences from patients were almost identical to the Bat CoV ZC45 coronavirus. It was critical to study where the pathogen came from and how it passed onto human. An article published on The Lancet reported that 27 of 41 infected patients were found to have contact with the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan. We noted two laboratories conducting research on bat coronavirus in Wuhan, one of which was only 280 meters from the seafood market. We briefly examined the histories of the laboratories and proposed that the coronavirus probably originated from a laboratory. Our proposal provided an alternative origin of the coronavirus in addition to natural recombination and intermediate host.

In summary, somebody was entangled with the evolution of 2019-nCoV coronavirus. In addition to origins of natural recombination and intermediate host, the killer coronavirus probably originated from a laboratory in Wuhan. 

Who is Botao and should anyone listen to him? Well, yes: this is what we find about the research group of the Harvard post-doc:

The Xiao group study mainly in the fields of cellular and molecular biomechanics, single molecule biophysics and engineering. Current research areas are: protein-ligand interactions, DNA and RNA assembly, high-throughput nanometer measurements and manipulation, mathematical modeling and quantitative analysis. The experimental techniques include: magnetic tweezers, optical tweezers, biomembrane force probe, fluorescent microscopy, genetic engineering, and chromatography. An project example is using high-throughput single molecule techniques to study the modulation of protein drugs on interactions of integrins and their ligands such as TGF-beta. We also study von Willebrand Factor and glycoproteins on platelets. We collaborate with a number of well-known universities and institutions, and a few enterprises. Our research will be of relevance for the prevention and treatment of cancer, immune and cardiovascular diseases.

But what is far more interesting, and important, is that the paper was supported by China's National Natural Science Foundation, which means that the paper would likely never see the light of day if someone in Beijing did not stand to gain politically by endorsing the contrarian theory that a Wuhan biolab was indeed the source of the infection.

Which begs the question: is China's political elite set to change the narrative it has been spinning since day one about the origins of the coronavirus, and in order to appease an increasingly angry population, points the finger to one or more scientists at the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention and/or Wuhan Institute of Virology.

149,"## Grand Princess Cruise Ship Quarentined by CDC

Today, 02:51 PM**Grand Princess Health Advisory**

**Updated March 4, 2020**

Last night / early this morning, our chief medical officer Dr. Grant Tarling issued this Health Advisory Letter to guests and crew currently sailing onboard Grand Princess. A similar notification has been emailed to guests who sailed on the previous voyage. For guests who sailed on the previous Grand Princess voyage (Feb 11-21), if you have experienced any symptoms of acute respiratory illness with fever, chills, or cough since your return home, please immediately contact your medical provider. You can also [view the COVID-19 information card (PDF)](https://www.princess.com/news/pdfs/cdc-covid-19-info-card.pdf) provided by the CDC. **Guests Health Advisory – CoronavirusMarch 4, 2020**

Dear Princess Guest:

I wish to advise you that today we have been notified by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that they are investigating a small cluster of COVID-19 (coronavirus) cases in Northern California connected to our previous *Grand Princess* voyage that sailed roundtrip San Francisco from February 11 to February 21. We are working closely with our CDC partners and are following their recommendations.

For those guests who sailed with us on our previous voyage and may have been exposed, in an abundance of caution, the CDC requires you to remain in your stateroom until you have been contacted and cleared by our medical staff. A member of our medical team will be calling you between the hours of 8:00 AM and 11:00 AM this morning. You may order room service while you wait for the medical screening to be completed, and we apologize for any inconvenience.

Please be assured that the health, safety, and well-being of all guests and crew are our absolute priority. The CDC is continuing to actively collect information and has set up a meeting with us this morning to determine what, if any, actions need to be taken during this cruise and on arrival in San Francisco. We have shared essential travel and health data with the CDC to facilitate their standard notification to the State and County health authorities to follow up with individuals who may have been exposed to people who became ill.

As we anticipate that further review of the situation will be necessary on arrival in San Francisco, we will be cancelling the call to Ensenada on Thursday, March 5, in order to sail directly to San Francisco and arrive on Thursday afternoon. We will keep you updated with information as we finalize plans. To assist you in contacting your family, we are providing free internet and phone service. We will advise you if the need arises to make changes to your onward travel plans post-cruise.

COVID-19 causes mild illness in about 80% of cases, typically with symptoms of fever, cough and shortness of breath, like the common cold or flu. About 20% of people develop more severe symptoms. The more severe symptoms typically occur in more susceptible individuals that have higher risk factors, such as older adults and those with chronic medical conditions, as it does with regular flu. The illness is mainly spread by droplets from close person-to-person contact. It is possible for the virus to spread by hand touch surfaces, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. Updated information on the illness can be found at the [CDC website](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/).

As with all respiratory illnesses, particularly during cold and flu season, you can take steps to reduce your risk of illness:

1. Wash your hands often with soap and water for 20 seconds.
2. Supplement hand washing by regularly using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
3. Avoid close contact with people suffering from respiratory illness.
4. Cover your nose and mouth when you cough or sneeze using a tissue or your bent elbow.
5. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.

We are closely recording and monitoring all persons who have reported to the medical center with cold and flu symptoms during the voyage. As a precaution, we are also conducting additional enhanced environmental disinfection onboard in addition to our regular stringent cleaning and sanitation protocols.

If you have experienced any symptoms of acute respiratory illness with fever, chills, or cough at any time during this cruise, and you have not already consulted with the medical staff, please immediately contact the Medical Center to report your illness. There will not be a charge for this service.

Thank you for taking the time to read this important information.

Yours in health,

&gt; The Chinese air force's aerobatics team took extra precautions, met Singapore's criteria for health, and passed all checks before they arrived here for the upcoming airshow, said Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen yesterday.

&gt; That both the Chinese and United States air forces are here for the biennial event, running from next Tuesday until Feb 16, testifies to Singapore's ties with the two countries, he added. ""It's really a vote of confidence. It's also a measure of how strong our relationship is,"" Dr Ng told reporters at the Changi Air Base (East) after meeting Chinese and American air force servicemen.

&gt; On Wednesday, Singapore Airshow organiser Experia Events said the People's Liberation Army's (PLA) Ba Yi aerobatics team will be taking part for the first time as one of five flying display performances.

&gt; The Government announced on Jan 31 that all new visitors who had been in mainland China in the past 14 days were barred from entry or transit in Singapore, starting from last Saturday. The move was part of Singapore's efforts to contain the coronavirus, which originated in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.

&gt; Asked about public concern over the exception made for the Chinese team, Dr Ng said: ""I think it's natural to be concerned, and they are just as concerned as us because we have cases here, and just like other pandemics, whether it's Sars or H1N1, once it goes into the community, you can get it from anywhere.

&gt; ""But we have been very careful and the PLA was particularly careful that they observed all requirements needed to be healthy, and they underwent stringent tests.""

&gt; He said he was grateful to US Defence Secretary Mark Esper for accepting his invitation for the US forces to perform at the airshow.

&gt; The aerospace and defence exhibition will be held at the Changi Exhibition Centre.

&gt; The invitation to the Chinese was sent to vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission Xu Qiliang and Defence Minister Wei Fenghe when Dr Ng visited China in October last year.

&gt; This is the 30th year of diplomatic ties between Singapore and China.

&gt; Yesterday, Dr Ng was accompanied by the Chief of Defence Force, Lieutenant-General Melvyn Ong, and the Chief of Air Force, Major-General Kelvin Khong, as he was given a tour of Ba Yi's J-10 fighter jets, and the US' F-22 Raptor and F-35B Joint Strike Fighter.

&gt; In a Facebook post yesterday, Dr Ng said he told the pilots to remain strong and stay focused. ""Our relationships with our close friends will withstand tough times and grow even stronger.""

152,"&gt;Last year almost 60k people died of flu in us. This seems like a lot of sinophobia.

It's really not. The emergence of unknown flu virus strains are always very concerning and need treating seriously which is why China is currently conducting the largest attempted quarantine in human history and countries are shutting their borders.  Pandemic flu has been a major concern for a long time and a consistent contender for the list of potential global disasters that could seriously knock back our civilisation.  Many experts have pointed at China as a major risk area of this happening for a long time due to the way they directly mix together animals of difference species in their farms and markets. 

Atm the known mortality rate of Wuhan coronavirus is believed to be about 2% higher than influenza so at the very minimum that's an extra 180,000 deaths a year in the US (if it becomes uncontainable) but for all we know that information may be very wrong.  The scientists do not have a proper handle on this at all yet so it may be much more infectious than common strains of influenza, it may have a higher mortality rate than we think, we don't know how quickly it mutates and there is no vaccine available for an estimate of at least 6 months.  We recently found out that it's infectious before a patient becomes symptomatic which may indicate the spread of the virus is much worse than we feared as people will have been walking around spreading the virus without realising they are seriously ill and Xi Jinping called the situation ""grave"" which is pretty alarming language from a country that tends to downplay the seriousness of any internal issues.  The absolute worst case would be that it's highly infectious, it goes global, it mutates often making vaccines worthless and it either has a higher mortality rate than is being revealed or it mutates from it's current form to have a higher mortality rate to match something like SARS (another coronavirus) that killed almost 10% of the people it infected.  That's unlikely but even in the best case we really don't want this running rampant globally especially in the poor densely populated countries who will not have the capacity to deal with it.",0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

&gt;The corona virus is another virus to add to those of recent history including SARS, H1N1, MERS, Zika, Ebola.  While they were all different, the similarities are that they do die out and while investors get scared, markets do recover fairly quickly.   In this sharp downturn over the past two weeks it is believed that nearly three-fourths of all trades has been conducted by computer algorithms, programmed to automatically react to pieces of news.  Market swings then become more extreme because human investors aren’t the ones making the trading decisions.  Computer algorithmic trading is not new – it has been with us for a long time.
&gt;
&gt;We believe that the virus has created a selloff that is unwarranted.  Just a month ago the economy was quite strong and while 2020 may become a recession, we expect the economy to revert back to normal growth once the virus dies off.  In fact, pent up demand could drive meaningful economic growth.  While we don’t know the timing of the virus expiration, history suggests that the losses after sharp market declines are usually recouped within a year when calm again prevails.

I agree if the issue at hand is because of a systemic problem, not an issue of the copmany itself. We are currently in a pandemic, something the companies are not at fault for and that they couldn't predict in time to have necessary funds available to prepare for that. If a company fails because of Corona, it is NOT a saign that it is a bad company, it just that they couldn't be prepared to a situation where no preperation was possible.

[Did Trump try to cut the CDC's budget as Democrats claim?: ANALYSIS](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-cut-cdcs-budget-democrats-claim-analysis/story?id=69233170)  
 

The president introduced his fiscal year 2021 budget proposal on Feb. 10, just 11 days after the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak a public health emergency of international concerns. The spending plan included a 16 percent reduction in CDC funding from the 2020 spending levels.

In fact, all of Trump’s budget proposals have called for cuts to CDC funding, but Congress has intervened each time by passing spending bills with year-over-year increases for the CDC that Trump then signed into law.  
[Did Donald Trump fire pandemic officials, defund CDC?](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/feb/28/michael-bloomberg/did-donald-trump-fire-pandemic-officials-defund-cd/)

On the first point, it’s hard to pin down whether the National Security Council staffers were ""fired"" in 2018, but they certainly left abruptly and have not been replaced, though other leaders in the coronavirus fight have been named in recent days.

On the second point — funding — there’s no question that the Trump administration sought to cut key CDC budget categories that would be involved in emerging infections like coronavirus. But Bloomberg overlooks that, thanks to Congress, that funding was restored and even increased in bills that were ultimately signed by Trump.

The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.

157,"&gt; As France faces a surge in containment measures to escape the spread of the Covid-19 coronavirus, there is hope for medical treatment.

&gt; Professor Raoult announced on Monday 16 March that the first cases treated at the IHU, the reference centre for covid-19, with chloroquine are on the way to recovery.

&gt; The treatment has been offered to 24 patients, among the first contaminated in south-eastern France, admitted to IHU on a voluntary basis.

&gt; As usual, Professor Didier Raoult, director of the IHU in Marseille, posted the conclusions of his trial online in a video.

&gt; ""*We included in this treatment people who agreed, almost all of them. Two cities without the protocol, Nice and Avignon, provided us with patients who didn't receive the treatmen*t,"" the epidemiologist explained.

&gt;""*We found that patients who had not received Plaquenil (hydroxychloroquine) were still carriers after six days, whereas when you put Plaquenil on, after six days, there are only 25% carriers*.

&gt; Professor Raoult had obtained approval from health authorities to test chloroquine treatment on patients at IHU on March 9. 

&gt; Chloroquine is a commonly used and inexpensive anti-malarial drug, whose virtues had been praised by the director of the Institut Méditerranée Infection at the end of February on the basis of a Chinese study.

&gt; This treatment uses a precise dosage: ""600mg per day for ten days"", the professor detailed in his speech.

158,"Today. The full extent of what this virus has effected has finally set in for me. My reasoning for this realization is a bit selfish, and I am/have been deeply concerned for and feel sorry for those effected, but sometimes something doesn’t become real for you until it effects you personally. 

   Recently I (14F) have been having a lot of back pain. It started about a month and a half ago when I pulled/injured something during my PE safety test. It steadily got worse over a few weeks, and when I asked my gym teacher she told me “you probably just pulled a muscle,  it hurts, but if you stretch you should be fine”. So I followed her advice and it only really hurt if I slept on it funny, so I moved forward, didn’t think anything of it. I’ve had back pain before, no big deal. 

   Fast forward to about Thursday last week. I went to move a chair, and before I had even lifted it, my back went out. I Don’t know exactly what is wrong, how I hurt it, what exactly I did to it, etc. All I know is that it hurt. This time it hurt far worse than when I originally hurt it, but again I stretched it and took it easy, and by Saturday evening I was pretty much fine. 

   Skip again to this morning. I was going up some stairs to go to my room, where it was quiet, so that I could take a test. As I was going up the stairs my back went out again. This time it was far worse than either if the other times. The pain was absolutely excruciating. It felt worse then when I had broken my arms, or dislocated my knee cap. It was by far the worst pain I’ve ever felt. Throughout the day my parents have done whatever they could to help the situation at home, I’ve been taking aleve, laying down, heating pad, TENS machine, etc. It feels better, but not good, and I don’t know what to do about it. 

   Okay, here’s the COVID-19 part. Ordinarily, by now my parents would have taken me to the doctor, and today I would have been in the ER, but obviously do to Covid, that isn’t an option. There are just too many health risks. And if any of us were possibly exposed to it, my dad wouldn’t be able to go to work. Not to even mention we have my immunocompromised  grandmother to protect. I know I would still have been in pain at the hospital, but they are also aloud to prescribe better pain medicine, and get to the root of my problem to potentially fix it. 

   I also had the realization that there are probably tons of other people who are struggling with their own health issues, but can’t go to the hospital because of COVID-19, and it really sucks to lie around in pain and not be able to get any treatment. So I know it’s selfish, and I know that there are a lot of people dying from the virus, and I wish that no one had to go through that, but for me it didn’t get real until today. 

TL;DR: 
It got real for me today when I wasn’t able to go to the doctor after getting hurt because of COVID-19.",0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0

Almost 100 foreign citizens who had been in China — many of them “business leaders” — were snuck in Australia’s back door after the federal government gave them an exemption from the coronavirus travel ban.

It is understood the business leaders, diplomats and other travellers allowed to enter Australia passed an initial health screening and state health departments rubber-stamped the request. Each individual was also required to self-isolate for 14 days.

However, medical research platform medRxiv has warned that, based on cases from China, symptoms may not manifest themselves for as long as 24 days.

Obviously there is also the concern that one or more of these special exemptions may have broken their self-isolation at some stage.

The Sunday Telegraph can reveal that Australia’s border boss authorised border clearance for 99 non-citizens.

Last month the government announced any foreigner who had travelled to China would not be allowed to enter Australia for 14 days from the time they left.

The National Security Committee of Cabinet agreed to the ban on February 1 in an attempt to try and stop the spread of the coronavirus.

On Friday the government extended its coronavirus travel ban for another week amid fears a Covid-19 global pandemic will soon be declared

The ban does not apply to Australian citizens, permanent residents and their immediate family as well as aircrews.

The government confirmed that Australia’s Border Force Commissioner has used his discretionary powers on 28 occasions to permit entry to 99 foreigners.

A spokesman from the Department of Home Affairs said the Commissioner only used discretionary powers in “compelling or compassionate circumstances” and where the relevant health authorities support the request.

Diplomats who are residents in Australia and Chinese citizens receiving treatment in Australia or visiting sick loved ones were also among those smuggled in.

Hydroxychloroquine has a markedly well tolerated side effect profile. Really the big issue is retinal toxicity (long term eye damage affecting permanent vision), which arguably isn't seen in those on treatment for less than 5 years at a dose of at least 5 mg/kg/day. In my world (rheumatologist), it's pretty much the safest thing we prescribe.

The biologics definitely have a more significant side effect profile. Infection is the main one. But, this is with long term use. It's looking like potential use in Covid, at least from what I've read thus far, would be short term (1 or 2 doses), so it'd be tough to know at this point what the side effect and toxicity profiles would look like.

I think a big part here would also be potential potency. Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are being selected based on potential anti-viral properties. The mentioned biologics have a much broader - and I would speculate much more profound - impact on dampening the over active immune response we're seeing in severe Covid.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Dear BC Community, 
 
This is a challenging time for the College on a number of different levels, but I wanted to assure our community that even with the transition in leadership, BC is working collaboratively, and swiftly, with campus stakeholders from multiple departments to address the COVID-19 outbreak. As Dennis Curran stated in an earlier email, we are committed to the safety of our students, faculty, and staff.   
 
Based on the recommendations made by Public Health - Seattle &amp; King County yesterday and today, the College is taking the following actions: 
 
1.	The College will remain open for the time being, with the following caveats: 
o   Supervisors are encouraged to allow their employees to telework to the greatest extent possible, for the next three weeks (through March 27th). Please work with your supervisor to determine who is able to telework. There is more information attached on the COVID-19 - Leave and Work Options for Faculty and Staff. 
·        Effective tomorrow (Friday), instruction for the remainder of the quarter will continue online or through alternate modalities. Faculty are asked to move classes online and/or to institute alternate means of instructions for the rest of winter quarter. Some exceptions for essential functions (e.g., health care students, computer access) are still being discussed. The AVP of Instruction, Rob Viens, will send out an email later today with more information. 
o   Students – instruction will continue for the remainder of the quarter and every effort will be made for you to finish winter quarter classes. Your instructors will contact you regarding plans for your classes. Please make plans on how to access online materials and visit your course Canvas site regularly for information. Contact your instructor with any course related questions, or concerns about having access to appropriate technology. 
§  VETERAN students: Please note your benefits will not be impacted by shifting to online modality during this time.  
o   Effective tomorrow, Friday, March 5th, non-essential events with more than ten participants will be cancelled through March 27th.  This includes all external customer events on campus. 
o   Effective Friday, March 5th, non-essential meetings with more than ten participants will be rescheduled or move online through March 27th.  It is the responsibility of the meeting organizer to determine whether a meeting is essential; meetings that are not essential can continue through Microsoft Teams or Skype. 
·        The computer lab in N201 will remain open for students who need to access their services.  
·        The Cafeteria will ramp down operations over the next several days and close completely beginning March 9th.  The cafeteria will reopen at the beginning of Spring quarter, April 1st.   
                                                    i.The Pizza kitchen will remain open from 8 a.m. – 8 p.m. Monday through Friday. 
                                                   ii.The C Building coffee shop will remain open 7 a.m. – 8 p.m. Monday through Thursday and 7 a.m. - 2:45 p.m. on Fridays. 
                                                  iii.The T Building coffee shop will remain open 8 a.m. – 5 p.m. Monday through Thursday and will close operations beginning March 13th through March 31st and will reopen for normal hours on April 1st.  
                                                  iv.The food pantry, located by Student Programs on the second floor of the C Building, is available to students while supplies last. Donations for the pantry will continue to be accepted at the same location. 
·        The Early Learning Center will remain open for normal operating hours until further notice.  The ELC is closing early tomorrow, March 6, to disinfect the classrooms and equipment. 
o   This is not an exhaustive list.  If you have questions about an event, meeting or something else, please contact your supervisor or instructor for further information. 
 
2.    	Flu Team will issue guidance tomorrow about Bellevue College-related travel. 
 
3.     It 	portant to note that people are NOT at risk because of their race, nationality, or ethnicity. Having Chinese ancestry—or any other ancestry—does not place a person at higher risk for COVID-19. You can help keep our campus safe and inclusive for everyone by sharing accurate information with your fellow community members. To report a bias incident, please fill out at a report at www.bellevuecollege.edu/reportconcerns. 
 
What you can do 
 
We strongly recommend students and employees who are sick follow public health recommendations to stay home.  In addition, Public Health - Seattle &amp; King County recommends that people with higher risk of severe illness should stay home and away from large groups of people as much as possible. Employees can report sick days through the usual channels, and work with HR if they need to request shared leave.  Employees should talk to their supervisor/dean about making arrangements to work from home where that is feasible. Always remember to wash your hands and avoid unnecessary contact (e.g., handshakes). Please do your best to reduce the spread of disease. 
 
Please continue to report issues related to possible COVID-19 exposure to the CARE Team using Report Concerns. 
 
Will Campus Close? 
At this time, public health officials are not recommending suspension of campus operations. Bellevue College is closely monitoring COVID-19 updates provided by the Washington State Department of Health, Public Health - Seattle &amp; King County, and the Centers for Disease Control. We will continue to follow the guidance of health officials and provide updates and resources as they become available.  
 
T Building Closure &amp; Custodial Support 
We appreciate your cooperation and patience with the temporary closure of the T Building on Tuesday. I’d like to thank our staff and students for calmly evacuating the building and especially our dedicated custodial crew for cleaning and sanitizing the facility.   
Additionally, please be patient with the status of our cleaning operations.  It may be a few weeks until we get back to normal operations as we focus on sanitizing and disinfecting the most used areas. 
 
Stay healthy. Practice good hygiene habits. As the situation develops, we will continue to update the campus.

They just haven't seen the compilations of Biden's brain melting. It's not a stutter people. He's had multiple brain aneurysms, he is not fit for office, COME ON. They're totally tuned off to the political landscape. They have nostalgia of Obama, and remember Biden was his VP. He beat Palin and Ryan in a debate and they remember how he was back then. He isn't the same, not even close, mentally. He's the same policy wise as when he pushed for the Crime Bill to target minorities, when he pushed for the War on Drugs (he's still against legalizing marijuana), and when he supported the Iraq War, and he is still against the massively popular Medicare for All, which was a slight majority popular among Republicans before Coronavirus, and I'd imagine it is even more popular now.

Also, the way Biden aggressively attacks people on camera for challenging his ideas / words / voting record, threatening to assault them, challenging them to pushups, telling them to go vote for someone else. Imagine if Bernie did that, what the mainstream media would do. CNN and MSNBC would be calling for him to immediately drop out for his disqualifying behavior and check into a mental hospital. It's pathetic that they let Biden get away with everything. There is such a double standard, they just laugh off Biden being senile and doing these bizarre things and pretend nothing unusual is happening there, because they're so scared of Bernie being President. Trump is heavily favored to win if he's against Biden, the writing is on the wall.",1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The ""crash and animal carcass"" disposal cabin can maintain ""2 second incineration"" and burn 5 tons of carcasses per day. (Weibo picture)

[NTD Beijing, February 18, 2020] Wuhan pneumonia continues to spread and the death toll is difficult to count. Lu Media said that 40 ""cabins for the disposal of garbage and animal carcasses"" have aided Wuhan in the epidemic area. This cabin can sustain ""2 seconds incineration"" and burn 5 tons of corpses per day. Scholars believe that ""things are not simple."" Netizens said, ""It's terrible ... how many people have died?""
According to Lu Media's report on the 18th, the prevention and control of pneumonia in Wuhan is severe. In order to meet the demand for medical pneumonia burning in Wuhan, a ""medical waste emergency treatment cabin"" recently developed by the Air Pollution Control Team of the School of Environmental Science and Engineering of Shanghai Jiaotong University ""It became a"" cabin for the disposal of garbage and animal carcasses ""and sent it to Wuhan to aid the epidemic area.
This square cabin is the size of a 20-foot standard container and has a volume of about 30 cubic meters, including solid waste crushing square cabin, incineration square cabin and smoke purification square cabin. Mobile emergency treatment of domestic garbage, medical garbage, animal carcasses.
It is worth noting that this type of incineration cabin is called incineration garbage, and it can actually incinerate animal carcasses.
Officials claim that the cabin can operate continuously and efficiently, burn 5 tons of medical waste animal carcasses daily, and perform harmless treatment at the same time.
This cabin is the ""National Key R &amp; D Plan during the 13th Five-Year Plan"" period, and the CCP military also participated in research and development. Just passed the military verification test in Golmud, Qinghai in January.
It is said that these square cabins were transported into Wuhan by large trucks, and the number was up to 40.
The ""crash and animal carcass"" disposal cabin can maintain ""2 second incineration"" and burn 5 tons of carcasses per day. (Weibo picture)
Qu Zan, a professor of the Shanghai Jiaotong University team environmental engineering school who is responsible for the air purification design of this cabin, said that the incineration in the cabin was maintained above 850 degrees for two seconds, and the virus could not survive in this condition. This technology is just helping the epidemic area. Wuhan.
Although the Chinese Communist Party authorities have desperately downplayed the function of this cabin to treat patients' corpses, Ming Ju, an emeritus professor at the National Taiwan University Political Department, believes that these cabins are ""mobile incinerators.""
Netizens have said:
""How can there be animal carcasses?""
""How many people have died, it's so sad!""

165,"&gt; Can you elaborate on this?

Well, as a friend used to say ""That's a four-beer conversation, maybe a full six pack"" because it's complicated and requires a lot of background knowledge. I've written extensively here on Reddit about CV19, the data, teasing meaning out of the conflicting information etc. I've put a, frankly, pretty stupid amount of time and effort into analyzing CV19 to predict likely outcomes for the U.S. under various scenarios.

However, I find the problem intriguing and it's perfectly suited to my professional background and experience in decision theory, risk analysis and outcome optimization. I'm exceptionally good at the maddening situations where there is a ton of data, everyone knows half of it must be wrong and no one knows which half. I've been doing exactly that professionally in the big business world for a few decades in domains where there are no right answers - only less wrong answers.

&gt; it presumes a correct understanding of the situation to begin with.

Yep, and no one understands this thing correctly yet. Not WHO, not CDC, and not me. For example, why is Wuhan different than Korea and why is Italy different than Japan? Why does the Diamond Princess data conflict with so much other data yet it should, methodologically-speaking, be some of the most accurate data? Why do the 565 Japanese evacuees from Wuhan seem different than those who stayed in Wuhan? Why is the CFR in Hubei province 2.9% but the CFR for every *other* province in China combined is only 0.4%? Welcome to my existence for the last two weeks. Trying tease meaning and reasonably actionable inferences out of this pile of noisy information to answer a few very specific questions. 

I think I've got about as good a set of answers as I can get given the quality of the input data. I fully acknowledge the error bars are wide and the confidence intervals low. But it's what we've got.

&gt; What am I missing?

Probably a nuanced understanding of the conflicting data picture along with a background in dealing with chaotic noisy data sets under conditions of extreme uncertainty with high stakes. I'll leave you with some links to a few of my more relevant or popular posts. I can't prove my understanding is correct (no one can), only that under given constraints and assumptions it is more probably correct than alternatives. But I do go to great lengths in most of my posts (aside from the occasional rant), to fully document my reasoning and assumptions, link to the source data and even identify key factors I could be wrong about.

166,"The farms being separate from cities is a plus. Back in the days when farms surrounded cities it was highly labor dependent, and there actually wasn't all the much autonomy. You had to depend on your family and neighbors to help you farm and get the crop in. It's why farm families were so freaking large. Children were literally a labor force you didn't have to hire. The model meant lots of farmers in close proximity with poor sanitation practices being the norm. Epidemics would actually wipe out entire villages. 

In wealthy countries at least farming is highly automated with relative handfuls of workers harvesting and processing lots of crops. Their are also some pretty stringent hygiene laws for how food is handled so the people who harvest, wash, and package food are actually pretty used to washing up. I've had to do a lot of writing on the FSMA for work, and no kidding, most of the outbreaks of foodborne illnesses we've had in the US the past have been because a deer or other got into the fields and took a dump and not because  someone forgot to wash their hands. 

Logistically speaking food processing and warehouses have a lot of automation. Transport wise truckers could get the virus and spread it. However, they lead busy but solitary lives that are spent mostly in a cab driving or sleeping. I'm inclined to think that they might actually have more insulation against contracting the virus than people in most walks of life.

We depend on power and water, but the grid is fairly robust. In urban areas we irritated if the power is knocked out for more than an hour because power companies can usually fix it by then. The supply chains that supply power companies with fuel are pretty solid, and once again automation and mechanization have made them a lot less dependent on labor. The water grid is more robust than the power in my experience. I've been through about thirteen hurricanes and while I've lost power in most of them I never lost water service.

The developing world may be another story. There are places where subsistence farming is still found, and they might lose more people than they can manage without. India and large swathes of sub-Saharan Africa have large populations that live without reliable access to clean water, or power and that is likely to make the fatality rate go up there. The west coast of the US, and several other cities have large homeless populations and the coronavirus is likely to be devastating to them. Now, I was homeless for awhile so when I say this please bear in mind that this was something I realized about my own plight. The people who are most likely to be seriously harmed by this are those that are already living outside of  society, and in a practical and very real sense they don't matter to society as a whole. They can die and the rest of the world won't notice at all. In a lot of cases their epitaph would be someone being relieved that the panhandler wasn't harassing them, or that their were fewer people outside of the Home Depot. Society would just go on without them.

As far as the disruption of the virus to society as a whole goes in the developed world I think it's more likely to be a severe economic slump. Lots of people exhausting their savings while they can't go into work. Companies laying people off while sales are down. Hardship made worse by more funerals, and more unexpected funerals than we can stand. Unpleasant, miserable, and unhappy, but not some apocalyptic scenario.",0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
167,"There are also a few other ways how you can help researchers.

By donating your idle processing power you can help the scientific world to understand the novel coronavirus faster and consequently accelerate the development of potential life-saving therapies.

Currently there are 2 projects that are working on the novel coronavirus - **Rosetta@home** and **Folding@home**. They deal with different tasks and are complementary. 

**Rosetta@home** [determines the 3D shapes of proteins](https://www.publish0x.com/what-is-volunteer-computing-and-why-do-it/wanna-help-fight-the-corona-virus-you-can-with-your-pc-by-do-xmegdl). It is available only for the BOINC app. BOINC is a platform developed by the University of California, Berkeley that lets researchers create and operate projects, and lets volunteers participate in these projects by donating idle CPU and/or GPU of their computers, tablets, and smartphones. In other words, BOINC is a supercomputer that instead of being located in one room is spread all around the world. If you want to participate, install the BOINC app and then choose Rosetta@home in the list to support.

**How do I know my idle processing power goes directly to fighting COVID-19?**

Besides coronavirus these projects are working on other diseases like cancer, HIV, malaria, Alzheimer’s and many others. By running Rosetta@home or Folding@home you will help researchers who study COVID-19, as well as others who research other diseases.  

**Does it actually help?**

Yes! Here is an [article](https://www.ipd.uw.edu/2020/02/rosettas-role-in-fighting-coronavirus/) describing Rosetta’s role in fighting the novel coronavirus. 

&gt;""We are happy to report that the Rosetta molecular modeling suite was recently used to accurately predict the atomic-scale structure of an important coronavirus protein weeks before it could be measured in the lab. Knowledge gained from studying this viral protein is now being used to guide the design of novel vaccines and antiviral drugs.""


**Personal experience on macOS (not an advanced user)**

I have been using the BOINC app for 2 weeks now and the only problem I had was an error during the account creation for Rosetta@home. Turning off my VPN let me create an account and log in. I am running the project with my VPN on and it works fine. 

The configuration is quite intuitive, the comprehensive list of settings is available on the rosetta@home website under your account (log in -&gt; click you nickname -&gt; computing preferences), a smaller portion is located in the preferences tab of the app itself. Changes that you make in the app are prioritised. 

I know that being hot is bad for any computer, so I set it up this way so the app uses at most 40% of the CPU when I am using it and 70% if I am not (my processor has 4 cores). This way it does not get hot even if I am using multiple apps.

BEIJING — China’s leader, [Xi Jinping](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/10/world/asia/xi-jinping-coronavirus.html), pledged to send more medical experts to Italy this week, on the same day Beijing sent 2,000 rapid diagnostic tests to the Philippines. Serbia’s president pleaded for assistance not from the country’s neighbors in Europe, which restricted the export of needed medical equipment, but from China. 

“European solidarity does not exist,” the Serbian leader, Aleksandar Vucic, said when he announced a state of emergency in [televised remarks](https://twitter.com/RushDoshi/status/1239645067066978311). “That was a fairy tale on paper. I believe in my brother and friend Xi Jinping, and I believe in Chinese help.”

Only a few weeks ago, China was overwhelmed by [the coronavirus ](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/world/coronavirus-news.html)epidemic that began in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, accepting donations of masks and other medical supplies from nearly 80 nations and 10 international organizations.

Now, with new daily cases at home dwindling into the single digits, [China is mounting](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/10/world/asia/coronavirus-china-xi-jinping.html) a diplomatic offensive to help, as the rest of the world struggles to get the virus under control. From Japan to Iraq, Spain to Peru, it has provided or pledged humanitarian assistance in the form of donations or medical expertise — an aid blitz that is giving China the chance [to reposition itself](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/04/business/china-coronavirus-government.html) not as [the authoritarian incubator](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/01/world/asia/china-coronavirus.html) of a pandemic but as a responsible global leader at a moment of worldwide crisis.

In doing so, it has stepped into a role that the West once dominated in times of natural disaster or public health emergency, and that President Trump has increasingly ceded in his “America First” retreat from international engagement.

“This could be the first major global crisis in decades without meaningful U.S. leadership and with significant Chinese leadership,” said Rush Doshi, director of the China Strategy Initiative at the Brookings Institution in Washington.

He noted that only a few years ago the United States led the fight against Ebola. 

The outbreak that started in Wuhan, which has infected nearly 200,000 people and killed nearly 8,000 worldwide, has been a [staggering setback](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/08/world/asia/xi-coronavirus-china.html) for Mr. Xi’s leadership, fanning discontent at home and questions abroad about the efficacy of the Communist state.

Now, the global failures in confronting the pandemic from Europe to the United States have given the Chinese leadership a platform to prove its model works — and potentially gain some lasting geopolitical currency.

As it has done in the past, the Chinese state is using its extensive tools and deep pockets to build partnerships around the world, relying on trade, investments and, in this case, [an advantageous position](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/business/masks-china-coronavirus.html) as the world’s largest maker of medicines and protective masks. The largess is going a long way to help temper popular anger over its [initial mishandling](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/01/world/asia/china-coronavirus.html) of the outbreak that is now wreaking havoc on every continent bar Antarctica.

“I don’t know and now I don’t care,” Michele Geraci, a former under secretary in the Italian economic development ministry, said in an interview when asked if the assistance reflected China’s geopolitical ambitions as much as humanitarian concerns.

He said the urgent issue was to provide aid to save lives, something that Italy’s allies in the European Union had been unable or unwilling to do.

“If somebody is worried China is doing too much, the gap is open to other countries,” he said. “This is what other countries should do.”

China has long aspired to assert a more prominent role in the United Nations and other international organizations while projecting its political, economic and military influence in more and more parts of the world — at times in direct competition with the United States.

“China is now trying to repair its severely damaged international image due to its mishandling of the outbreak in Wuhan in early January,” Minxin Pei, a professor of government at Claremont McKenna College in California, wrote in an email.

 “Donating medical supplies shows China is a responsible and generous world power,” he added. “It is also touting its success in containing the coronavirus outbreak to suggest its one-party regime is superior to the bumbling democracies in the West, in particular the U.S.” 

On Wednesday, China said it would provide two million surgical masks, 200,000 advanced masks and 50,000 testing kits to Europe. “We’re grateful for China’s support,” Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, [said in tweet](https://twitter.com/vonderleyen/status/1240300837068582915). “We need each other’s support in times of need.”

One of China’s leading entrepreneurs, Jack Ma, offered to donate 500,000 tests and one million masks to the United States, where hospitals are facing shortages despite having weeks of notice to prepare. In February, the United States flew in 17 tons of supplies to Wuhan aboard four flights that evacuated Americans from the city.

“This is no longer a challenge that a country can solve on its own, but it requires all of us to work together,” Mr. Ma’s foundation said in a statement that listed donations to dozens of countries, including all 54 nations in Africa.

The statement went on to cite Mr. Ma’s use on Weibo, a social media platform, of a familiar phrase in the American political lexicon: “United we stand, divided we fall.”

Chinese officials have insisted that a pandemic should be an arena for political cooperation, not competition. China’s success in slowing the disease’s spread, however, has emboldened officials and state media to push back harder — at times clumsily.

One foreign ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian, floated [a conspiracy theory](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/world/asia/coronavirus-china-conspiracy-theory.html) that the United States Army was behind the virus, while another [squabbled](https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/xwfw_665399/s2510_665401/t1756582.shtml) with Mario Vargas Llosa, the Peruvian author and Nobel Prize laureate, over a [newspaper column](https://elpais.com/elpais/2020/03/13/opinion/1584090161_414543.html) he wrote about the pandemic.",1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0

170,"The coronavirus outbreak is the biggest public health emergency in a generation.

 It calls for dramatic action, at home and abroad, of the kind not normally seen in peacetime.

 Our goal is clear. The over-riding objective is to protect life. Sadly 21 people have already died in the UK, and the fact that most had underlying health conditions does not make the grief of their families any lesser, nor our compassion for their family and friends any weaker. We must all do everything in our power to tackle this virus.

We have a plan, based on the expertise of world-leading scientists. Herd immunity is not a part of it. That is a scientific concept, not a goal or a strategy. Our goal is to protect life from this virus, our strategy is to protect the most vulnerable and protect the NHS through contain, delay, research and mitigate.

We are working through our clear action plan. Like all our decisions, the plan is based on the bedrock of the science, with maximum transparency. We will do the right thing at the right time, based on the best available science. 

To protect life, we must protect the vulnerable, and protect the NHS and flatten the curve.

From the moment coronavirus emerged, we have followed those goals.

We have acted to contain the spread of the virus so far. We have carried out some of the highest number of tests in Europe, our surveillance testing is among the most sophisticated in the world and the UK’s plans for the rapid response to and mitigation of the spread of an epidemic are ranked number one above any other country by the Global Health Security Index. Most importantly of all, thanks to our record levels of tracing the number of people who came into contact with the first people who caught the virus, the initial growth was slowed significantly, and the growth of the virus in the UK has been slower than many major European countries. This action has already prevented the NHS being put under greater pressure in its hardest season of the year. We have bought valuable time to prepare.

Last week we stepped into the next phase of our response. We took action to advise anyone with symptoms, however mild, to stay at home. This advice from the Chief Medical Officer will be reinforced with a national communications campaign so everyone knows what they can do: how you can play your part. The new campaign will set out the latest clinical advice, for people to stay at home for seven days if they develop a high temperature or new continuous cough.  We can all keep doing our bit by continuing to wash our hands more often, for 20 seconds or more and having plenty of tissues around to ‘catch it, bin it, kill it’. Following this new advice may sound simple, but it could be lifesaving for others around us, especially the most vulnerable.

Today, we take further action, with a call to arms for a drive to build the ventilators and other equipment the NHS will need. We are better equipped thanks to the NHS than most other countries, but we will need many more. We now need any manufacturers to transform their production lines to make ventilators. We cannot make too many.

In the near future we will take further steps. SAGE has advised the next planned effective interventions will need to be instituted soon, including measures to ‘shield’ older and medically vulnerable people from the virus. Everyone will need to help to ensure they get the support they need to stay at home, and to protect them from the consequences of isolation: loneliness, and a lack of support. Government, local councils, charities, friends and neighbours will need to be part of the national effort to support the shielded. We will provide expert advice and support as soon as we progress to this phase.

Next week we will publish our emergency bill, to give the Government the temporary powers we will need to help everyone get through this. The measures in it allow for the worst case scenario. I hope many of them won’t be needed. But we will ask Parliament for these powers in case they are.

Our generation has never been tested like this. Our grandparents were, during the Second World War, when our cities were bombed during the Blitz. Despite the pounding every night, the rationing, the loss of life, they pulled together in one gigantic national effort.

Today our generation is facing its own test, fighting a very real and new disease. We must fight the disease to protect life. Everyone will be asked to make sacrifices, to protect themselves and others, especially those most vulnerable to this disease. With our clear action plan, listening to the advice of the best science, and taking the action we all must, I am sure we will rise to this challenge.",0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0

Watching the press conference right now, glad something is finally happening. Other notes from the briefing:  
  
- Inslee asking all managers/business leaders to change policy and allow telecommuting if possible  
- Asking vulnerable people to not go outdoors or to gatherings  
- Asking public transit districts to follow King County's lead on increased sanitizing  
- Wants to fight as much as possible to reduce the risk of an ""avalanche"" of people that need serious medical attention, even with planning this capacity will be ""stretched at best""  
- If your physicians discuss with you advising delaying non essential surgery please listen to them to reduce strain on hospitals  
- Schools: Children seem to be relatively free of serious disease associated with this, but the best science tells us they can transmit the disease to other people they come to contact with  
- Schools: Inslee is asking all schools to ***immediately*** begin planning for school closures in next several days  
- Schools: Expects to give more guidance in the next few days and will be in touch with King/Pierce/Snohomish county school leaders  
- Likely have thousands of infections or potential infections, doing this is to slow the epidemic  
  
Dow Constantine portion (King County Executive) notes:  
  
- Expresses the concern for those who know people that have passed and for those fighting the illness at the moment  
- Doing what they believe (talking to health officials) is the best current step to slow the stem of the virus  
- Believes ***gatherings smaller than 250 should still not happen unless clear steps are taken to slow virus***  
- ***Will be signing an order to prohibit gatherings smaller than 250 unless they can prove (with review) that health checks and social distancing are being followed correctly to the advice of health officials***  
- Has spoken with leaders of sports teams, they ""understand"" that they need to be doing everything in their scope as well  
- Wants to preserve the limited capacity of King County healthcare system. Delay spread to stop this from overflowing. Responsibility of everyone equally  
- Targeted approach to allow economy to continue. If businesses can be shown to meet criteria to help slow the spread, they should absolutely continue  
- Policymakers must ask if they are taking the most appropriate measures to help in this crisis, today's actions help keep people from harm  
- Epidemiologists say that doubling rate is roughly ""5-7 days"" and that fact underscores the urgency as to why these measures are being taken  
- Wants to thank leadership from the business community as actually helping, and going beyond, with the slowing of spread. Specifically thanks Microsoft for offering to give paid time off for hourly workers to help delay spread  
- Thanks everyone for joining today, will now allow Dr. Jeff Duchen to speak  
  
Dr. Jeff Duchin:  
  
- Notes that this will absolutely cause disruption to people's daily lives  
- Recognizing increasing spread of COVID-19 in community  
- As testing increases, more and more cases are being shown. Multiple instances of COVID-19 in Long Term Care facilities  
- Expects a ""large scale"" outbreak within weeks, equivalent to a major earthquake but the shaking will last for ""weeks and weeks""  
- Will be a difficult time for all going forward  
- Social distancing is intending to slow the epidemic, though ""we know we cannot stop it""  
- By delaying the spread it will have less impact on community and healthcare system  
- Many ""older adults and many community members with underlying"" items that *will* require healthcare through the healthcare system  
- Early, comprehensive, sustained social distancing is required to help those vulnerable  
- Need to make sure we minimize who becomes ill or the healthcare system will not be able to provide care  
- By taking steps now/acting together, we reduce personal risk of exposure and transmitting, but also reduces for those most vulnerable  
- As Executive mentioned, Dr. Duchin is signing an order that ***prohibits events with fewer than 250 members unless event organizers can prove they are limiting spread***, does not apply to grocery stores or family gatherings  
- Schools: Need to plan for those that require school for medical or nutritional services in the event of a closure  
- Schools: Additional recommendations are coming  
- Review new CDC guidelines for preventing spread  
- Introducing Pierce County Executive  
  
Pierce County Executive Bruce Dammeier:  
  
- Very happy that most of us have the immune system that will help us through this  
- Increasing concern about seniors, pregnant women, and those with underlying issues, they are ""very vulnerable""  
- Supports actions in Pierce County  
- Knows there will be consequences, fundraisers are happening right now for non profits (scheduled), now more than ever those critical pieces of our community are required. Calling on everyone from Pierce County to support these non profits at this time

&gt;  
&gt;The virus genome consists of six major open reading frames (ORFs) common to coronaviruses and a number of other accessory genes (Fig.1b). Further analysis indicates that some of the nCoV-2019 genes shared less than 80% nt sequence identity to SARS-CoV. However, the seven conserved replicase domains in ORF1ab that were used for CoV species classification, are 94.6% aa sequence identical between nCoV-2019 and SARS-CoV, implying the two belong to same species(Extended Data Table 3). We then found a short RdRp region from a bat coronavirus termed BatCoV RaTG13 which we previously detected in Rhinolophus affinisfrom Yunnan Province showed high sequence identity to nCoV-2019. We did full-length sequencing to this RNA sample. Simplot analysis showed that nCoV-2019 was highly similar throughout the genome to RaTG13 (Fig. 1c), with 96.2% overall genome sequence identity. The phylogenetic analysis also showed that RaTG13 is the closest relative of the nCoV-2019 and form a distinct lineage from other SARSr-CoVs (Fig. 1d). The receptor binding protein spike (S) gene was highly divergent to other CoVs (Extended Data Figure 2), with less than 75% nt sequence identity to all previously described SARSr-CoVs except a 93.1% nt identity to RaTG13 (Extended Data Table3). The S genes of nCoV-2019 and RaTG13 S gene are longer than other SARSr-CoVs. The major differences in nCoV-2019 are the three short insertions in the N-terminal domain, and four out of five key residues changes in the receptor-binding motif, in comparison  
&gt;  
&gt;with SARS-CoV (Extended Data Figure 3). The close phylogenetic relationship to 96RaTG13 provides evidence for a bat origin of nCoV-2019.

175,"COVID-19 : Let's do a Work-From-Home experiment in New York

VOTE HERE: http://chng.it/h9CgB5wq

With this new coronavirus outbreak, working from home is no longer a privilege, it’s a necessity.
The sanitary risk of a 2019-nCoV outbreak in New York City is an opportunity for most companies to test working from home at scale.

Apart from contributing to a healthier environment, helping employers and employees save money on transportation and office space, and promoting equal opportunities in the employment market, working from home might be the most efficient containment measure each individual could take part of.

Of course, working from home is not ideal, it's a skill, it takes time to acquire, both for employees and employers. It’s going to mean a lot of video chats and phone calls, but many tools are already available for a reasonable price: Slack, Zoom, Yammer, Dropbox, Google Drive.... and or course VPN tools to improve cybersecurity. 

Yes, some jobs are not really adapted. Retail industry for example, but most importantly some critical services like power generation, grid services, communications, and food production. However, those services only require a small percentage of the population to maintain in the modern days.

Focusing first on tech companies, advertising firms, and financial institutions would make sense. A growing number of US companies are already working as fully distributed teams. More recently, some Chinese corporate giants including Alibaba Group and Tencent have asked staff to work from home for one week after an extended Lunar New Year break ends, seeking to limit the spread of the 2019-nCoV virus.

A 2015 study from Stanford University in California found that productivity among employees at a Chinese travel agency went up by 13% when they worked from home due to fewer breaks and more comfortable work environments.

Working from home seems to result in higher productivity, help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution, commute congestion, and most importantly would be an efficient measure to contain a possible rapid outbreak of the 2019-nCoV virus in densely populated cities such as New York City.
It's time for New Yorkers to lead the country's largest work-from-home experiment!",0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

177,"Yeah, I don’t see any other answer. It’s just not reasonable to think with the number of confirmed cases spread all over the country that they haven’t all been responsible for some level of community transfer. And any confirmed cases at this point are only the most severely ill which means they’ve had the virus for a relatively long time and have probably come into contact with a larger group of people. 

It ALSO means, by definition of the test eligibility criteria, that we have intentionally not tested a whole lot of people who were showing symptoms. We’ve heard many stories now of people basically begging to be tested and the CDC refused to authorize the test. So in addition to the community transfer of the confirmed cases, we have a much larger population of people that the CDC refuses to test. And remember, 80% of all cases fall in the “mild symptom” category. 

So if the CDC will only authorize severely symptomatic patients who meet strict criteria to be tested, then isn’t it reasonable to think that only the 20% “sickest” patients would get tested? So the confirmed count is, I think, conservatively only 20% of the cases currently in the US. So I think, at a minimum, the real number of infected is 5x greater than the current count, and that’s just doing the simple math based on what we know about the testing criteria and the severity ratios of the virus, add in the fact that most likely not even all severe cases have been identified yet and I think the number could realistically be quite a bit more. 

So that’s a whole lot of unconfirmed cases of the Corona virus. Now consider this, all of those currently undiagnosed people are, at this moment, spreading the virus further. What’s the country going to look like in another couple weeks? Scary stuff. 

TLDR: I did the math on what I think is a much more realistic number of current US cases and it’s at least 5x what’s been reported. See post for evidence.",0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Count the percentages against us getting infected or dying. And listing things I am doing to lower that percentage.

For example, they say 50% of Americans could be infected. But If I social isolate and dont go out unless for essential things like food or medicine. This rate should drop significantly.

Then if I wash my hands as much as possible and don’t touch my face; that is another slash on my infection rate. Also, if I go out for an emergency, I stay 6 feet apart and wear something to cover my mouth/nose.

Then, if I get infected, there is only 20% change of hospitalization and 3.5% of dying. Luckily I am in my 30s so should help getting sever cases. But what if I am one of the unlucky ones?

For example Vitamin C helps to have a stronger inmune system, so We have been drinking Orange use with lots of pulp. Vitamin D has been proven to help against infection, so we go out to catch 15-30 mins of sun to our backyard. Lactobacillus have been found to help avoid Cytokinesis when you get pneumonia (how covid basically kills you) so we are eating yogurt etc.

Hello????!!!! the majority of colleges in nyc are closing and doing online course....like I said we can thank this school later cause thay are sending their students allover New York like little worker bees helping to propagate and add fuel to the fire instead of being proactive now instead of waiting till the last second when they could be forced to close and start online courses ...way to go, nice way to spread  disease, germs and possibly  the coronavirus itself !...plus the fact that you have indoor classes still going on  even better more contact with students who have been exposed to it all  ....thanks !!!!!",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

190,"Copy and pasted from behind the paywall: Thousands of passengers remained on a cruise ship held off the coast of San Francisco Saturday as officials debated the origins of the coronavirus outbreak that has prevented them from disembarking.

The fate of the Grand Princess has become a significant public health challenge, with a dozen coronavirus cases in California linked to passengers who traveled on the ship to Mexico last month. They include a Placer County man who died of COVID-19 on Wednesday.

At least 21 of the nearly 3,000 people who subsequently took the same ship to Hawaii have tested positive for the virus. All of those passengers remain on board, and many more still need to be tested. It’s unclear what will happen to those who are found to be sick.

A cruise line medical officer said Saturday that the man who died brought the virus with him when he boarded the Grand Princess — a point public health officials disputed.

Dr. Grant Tarling, the cruise’s medical officer, said the man — who died at Kaiser Permanente Roseville Medical Center after leaving the ship — sought medical care onboard on Feb. 20 and had been sick for several days. Tarling said two waiters who served the man multiple times were subsequently infected.
If true, it could mean there was so-called community spread of the virus in California earlier than had previously been detected.

A Placer County health officer, however, questioned Tarling’s statement and said the passenger probably contracted the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 while on the cruise.

“Placer County Public Health has been consistent in our message that our first COVID-19-related fatality likely contracted the disease during international travel to Mexico,” Dr. Aimee Sisson said. “As is standard public health practice, we have based our assessment on the information learned in our contact investigation as well as what we know to be true about the disease pattern.”
Though Princess Cruises officials indicated the short period between the Placer County man boarding the ship and the onset of his symptoms suggested he brought the virus on board, the incubation period for COVID-19 is still unkonwn. The World Health Organization puts it between one and 14 days, most commonly around five days.

Dr. Thomas Frieden, former head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention during the Obama administration, agreed the average incubation period was five to six days, with a range between two days and two weeks.

“We don’t yet know when people who have symptoms are infectious, and for how long,” Frieden said.
Coronavirus cases had been confirmed in California as early as January, tied to travel from China.
The 75-year-old Placer County man said his symptoms began two to three days after boarding the Grand Princess, according to Tarling.

President Trump has expressed concern that allowing passengers to leave the ship would put the U.S. at risk of accelerating the coronavirus’ spread. Federal and state officials have grappled with how to deal with the cruise ship, where 19 crew members and two passengers have tested positive for the virus.

Vice President Mike Pence said Saturday that officials have developed a plan for passengers that will be implemented this weekend.

“All passengers and crew will be tested for coronavirus and quarantined as appropriate,” he said in a meeting with cruise line executives and port directors in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. “Those that require additional medical attention will also receive it.”

But few other details have been released about the plan.

Across the state, 88 people had been infected with the virus as of Saturday morning. In the U.S., there have been at least 439 confirmed cases, with most in Washington state, where 108 people have tested positive and 16 have died. More than 100,000 people have been infected worldwide, according to the World Health Organization.

In California, it is the Grand Princess cruise ship that has been causing worry of a more widespread outbreak.

By Saturday, the state said a dozen passengers of the Grand Princess cruise that returned to San Francisco on Feb. 21 had tested positive for the virus. Local officials reported four cases in Placer County, two in Contra Costa County, two in Sonoma County and one each in Santa Cruz, Ventura, Madera and Alameda counties tied to the cruise.

The Placer County man who sailed to Mexico is the state’s only confirmed COVID-19 fatality.

The Grand Princess was returning from Hawaii when it was held off the California coast. With testing still underway, officials don’t know how many of the more than 3,000 people on board have the virus.

Friday evening, gloves and masks were delivered to the cruise ship by helicopter, according to Negin Kamali, a spokeswoman for the Princess Cruises company. On Saturday morning, a critically ill passenger and their companion were evacuated from the ship by a Coast Guard cutter.
“They are being transported to a shoreside medical facility for treatment unrelated to COVID-19,” Kamali said. “The captain of Grand Princess and the Princess Cruises port operations team continue to await specific directives from state and local response operations about where the ship will proceed.”

Pence, who leads the task force in charge of the response, said the federal government is working with the state of California to bring the cruise ship into a noncommercial port over the weekend and quarantine those on board as necessary.

Trump said he would ultimately let Pence decide whether to allow passengers to leave the ship. But he said several times that he would be inclined to leave them on board because bringing them ashore would increase the number of official cases on American soil.

Passengers on the vessel — both current and those who may have been exposed earlier — told the Los Angeles Times that the response to the outbreak by the company and health officials had been filled with missteps.

In particular, passengers said Princess Cruises was lax on health screening protocols prior to boarding and withheld information about the risks they faced, even as the ship’s situation became international news.

At a White House briefing, federal public health officials could not say precisely how many people have been tested for the virus.

They said 5,861 specimens have been taken by federal, state and local public health labs. Most patients give at least two samples, one from the nose and a second from the throat.

Dr. Stephen Hahn, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, promised a massive expansion of testing availability in the coming days. The CDC has shipped out 75,000 tests to public labs in 48 states and 1.1 million tests to commercial labs, with another 1 million tests going out Monday.

That’s enough for roughly 850,000 patients under the current protocols.
Meanwhile, at the Long Beach harbor Saturday, passengers aboard the Carnival Panorama cruise ship were not allowed off the vessel while officials dealt with a “medical matter,” according to a Facebook post by the cruise director.
Long Beach city officials said on Twitter that a passenger aboard the ship was taken to a hospital and is being tested for the coronavirus. According to the cruise director, the passenger did not meet the CDC criteria for coronavirus risk.
The ship is docked at a Long Beach terminal, but “in an abundance of caution, [the CDC] has decided to hold passengers on board until the patient can be evaluated,” the city of Long Beach account tweeted.

Siehara Kennedy, who is aboard the cruise ship, said passengers have been waiting more than three hours to get off. Passengers are not being isolated in their rooms and have been allowed to gather in the ship’s bars and casino, she said.
Elsewhere in the state, concerns over the coronavirus has led to canceled classes and events. The Elk Grove Unified School District, the largest in Northern California, announced Saturday it would close schools and cancel all student activities — including a prom — for a week to buy time and decide next steps.

Supt. Chris Hoffman said no students have tested positive for the virus, but some parents and family members have.
“I don’t know where this is going,” he said in a news conference. “I don’t know that anybody knows where its going.”

Washington state, where 108 people have been infected, appears to be bearing the brunt of the U.S. outbreak. Fourteen of the state’s 16 deaths are connected to the Life Care Center of Kirkland, a long-term care facility, according to Seattle &amp; King County Public Health. Officials said 15 people in the nursing facility have been hospitalized in the last 24 hours.
In New York, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo declared a state of emergency Saturday after the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the state rose to 76.

Surgeon at Treviglio hospital tells what happens in the ward: ""We bring messages to friends and relatives"". How daily life changes: ""I cut my hair and I see children with a mask""Treviglio, is not answering the phone from the lane. He is at home, to breathe, where he has a husband, a boy and a girl who he cannot embrace or allow to approach. Behind the heroes of this emergency, ""but which heroes ..."", she says, there are stories of sacrifices not only in the hours that are no longer counted between stretchers and beds but also in theirs, of families. The doctor had long blonde hair on her back and she cut them very short. It is not a habit, but a powerful image of her renunciation as a woman to continue being a doctor and mother. 'When I am about to get home, I tell my husband to keep the children away. I go to the bathroom, I throw everything to wash, I stand in the shower for 40 minutes, I rub it with soap and water. Then I put on my mask and, in any case, I keep my children at a distance. I cut my hair short to avoid taking anything home as much as possible. '

At home, for sure, his eyes are full of unpublished images even for an operating room doctor. By now, even the hands must have in memory the resuscitation maneuvers to save the salvable. He wanted to be a doctor and he doesn't deny him. He wanted a family and wants to protect it. «But we doctors must not be able to do what we do. Here are responsibilities with names and surnames. The red zone of the Seriana Valley had to be established immediately. Epidemiological studies were clear, from the beginning of Wuhan, and science is not an opinion "".

She is angry, ""we stand with anger. We don't have the tools to intervene on everyone, besides the protections ». It is not just the mantra that comes from multiple voices in hospitals. She is raw, with examples, because the soldier in the ward has no time and energy to be diplomatic with words. «The patient goes into respiratory arrest, you practice the cardiac massage because no, you doctor can't let him die, he looks at you. And when do you have to intubate him? You have the tube but you don't have the ventilator. Therefore? Age and comorbidity are exclusion criteria from the maneuvers. Now we have to intubate the forties. If tomorrow I come with diabetes, for example, I come after him. There is a lot of discussion about euthanasia, but these are people who, if we had the principals, could do it ».

""The patient looks at you,"" says the doctor, 50. At that moment, the doctor is not just a couple of hands that press desperately on a chest or insert a tube in the throat, when he can. It is also the only bridge between the patient and the outside world. Wives and husbands, children and grandchildren waiting for news behind the huge glass of collective isolation. “The patient knows what's going on, you read it in his eyes. ""Tell my wife I love her"" or ""send a greeting to my newborn granddaughter that I couldn't see,"" they tell you. We report to the patients the words that their family members give us on the phone, the cards with the messages and the drawings of the grandchildren they bring us, staying out. To relatives, we give news of the deaths on the phone. I had to communicate it to two children of a patient who live far apart. They couldn't even mourn him together. I'm not saying hold his hand, because we can't do it either. They die alone and are taken to a mortuary wrapped in a cloth with disinfectant. We doctors resist, we must, but we are already close to the psychological collapse due to fatigue, anxieties, and because we are losing close friends ».

The doctors, those who still resist. «A colleague with his pregnant wife has moved with another to a B&amp;B. Dozens and dozens are getting sick. They come with a fever but we cannot make a diagnosis, because we are too few, except when the symptoms are such that we can no longer stay here ». His here is half of the surgery department on the ""clean"" eighth floor, that is, without covid-19 patients, because the other half, on the same floor, has the infected. ""What I do? Where they are sick I go harnessed with the cap, the mask, two gowns because the most protective ones are missing. Then I stop in the middle of the corridor to communicate the patient data to the staff. The risk, going from one side to the other, is to infect "".

Dear Sir,



I'm emailing to ask whether you would review the following suggestion and communicate it upwards:

I have studied the situation closely with regards to hospitalisation rates due to Covid-19. As it is apparent that no health care system can support the demand for isolation wards, I have been considering possibilities for providing additional capacity and believe I have a solution worthy of further exploration, however I have no viable method of communicating this to the authorities, which is why I am emailing you in the hope that you could either propagate the suggestion, or direct me to the appropriate person.


From an engineering perspective it is apparent that hermetically sealed wards with power, o2 supply and generation, sanitation, and food preparation capability will be required. As of Jan this year, approx 780 Boeing 737-MAX aircraft are grounded. A significant number of these would be equipped with o2 generation capability. With the decline in air travel, a surplus of fuel should be available in reserves to enable these aircraft to be staged en-masse at airports, potentially powered by on board APU and self sufficient, with little more in the way of reconfiguration than removal of seating, to provide sealed wards; with o2 piping and generation, power generation, cooking and sanitary provision. This would provide immediate short term relief.

If/as the situation worsens, commercial air traffic will certainly be restricted or unavailable, thus providing additional aircraft and fuel reserves to draw upon.

&gt; March 16, 2020 4:18 pm by David Bond 

&gt;With Europe now the centre of the coronavirus outbreak and countries such as Germany, Poland and Denmark closing their borders to try to contain the spread of the disease, EU leaders have introduced a package of measures to help its 27 member states cope with the crisis.
&gt; 
&gt; On Sunday European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen announced an export authorisation scheme to prevent vital medical equipment leaving the bloc’s single market and an accelerated procurement process to help member states secure ventilators and testing kits.
&gt; 
&gt; “We need to keep goods flowing across Europe without obstacles,” she said in a video statement. “In this moment of national crisis it is of utmost importance to keep our internal market going.”
&gt; 
&gt; For the UK government, determined to plough on with talks on its future relationship with Brussels after Brexit, this poses an awkward dilemma.
&gt; 
&gt; Britain’s formal exit from the EU on January 31 means it is no longer an EU member state. However, as part of the transition arrangement, agreed last October in Boris Johnson’s withdrawal treaty and due to expire on December 31, the UK is still a part of the single market.
&gt; 
&gt; It is also still paying money into the EU budget as part of a £39bn divorce settlement — and while it may be difficult for the EU to sell it to its member governments, Britain should, in theory, be able to benefit from any EU-wide emergency funds.
&gt; 
&gt; It should — again in theory — also be able to participate in the joint procurement process, although it is worth noting that the UK is no longer listed as a signatory to the Joint Procurement Agreement (JPA), first adopted by the EU in 2013 to help countries obtain vital medicines and vaccines to tackle previous cross-border health threats such as the swine flu pandemic, H1N1.
&gt; 
&gt; The question for Mr Johnson, however, is whether it would be politically acceptable to ask Brussels for help — even if there are concerns in the UK over a shortage of the ventilators the NHS needs to treat patients with severe cases of coronavirus.
&gt; 
&gt; “As long as we are in the single market there’s no obvious reason that should stop us participating,” said Anand Menon, director at the think-tank UK in a Changing Europe.
&gt; 
&gt; “But the government is very sensitive to the perception that it needs the EU. Absurdly, given the situation we find ourselves in, the politics make that quite difficult to do.”
&gt; 
&gt; Interestingly, the draft treaty for the UK-EU future relationship, published last week by Brussels, includes a section on health security co-operation. It was added after talks on the EU mandate last month and covers the UK’s participation in an early warning system in the event of a crisis like the one we are seeing now.
&gt; 
&gt; The draft treaty states: “In case of a serious cross-border threat to health, the Union may grant the United Kingdom, upon its written request, with ad hoc access to an Early Warning and Response System (EWRS) established within the Union, in respect of that particular threat, for the purposes of alerting, assessing public health risks and determining the measures that may be required to protect public health.”
&gt; 
&gt; The EU ultimately sees health emergencies such as the one unfolding now as a matter where national governments have to play the leading role — that’s why they are prepared to accept the closure of national borders.
&gt; 
&gt; But the UK will be acutely conscious of the need to maintain access to vital medical supplies and protective equipment in the coming weeks and months, some of which will be produced in the bloc.
&gt; 
&gt; For example, as part of its export ban proposal the commission explained that production of personal protective equipment such as mouth protection masks was limited to a small number of EU states: Czech Republic, France, Germany and Poland.
&gt; 
&gt; Underlining the need for cross border co-operation, Ms von der Leyen added: “No country can produce on its own what it needs.”
&gt; 
&gt; Mr Johnson has so far shown he is prepared to take a very different course compared with his closest European partners in fighting the coronavirus. But could the politics of Brexit prevent the UK prime minister from requesting much needed help from Brussels if the emergency in the UK becomes as serious as the situation in Italy?

196,"I've posted this in another thread, i'll repost here as i think it's very relevant.

 

***WARNING : LONG ASS POST***

Firstly, please take the time watch this video from Hubei province, it shows that the official government line of only elderly and immunocompromised people dying may not be accurate.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBy3vY79PoQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBy3vY79PoQ)

There are so many people in this thread screaming hearsay and fear mongering when it comes to real figures, i'm generally a very sceptical person however I've lived in China, know a lot about it's government and culture and i still believe it is in the thousands (probably actually tens of thousands) dead. I'll justify my reasoning below.

Let's consider the following, and what it potentially means in terms of real deaths.

Starting with the actions of the Chinese government historically and presently.

**Facts:**

\- They've previously been caught out lying about SARS figures, lethality, infection rates and contagion spread multiple times in recent history. Both for ""saving face"" purposes and for economic and socioeconomic reasons. History showed the real figures to be significantly higher than the government information.

\- They're previously been caught lying and covering up real numbers and figures for Avian-flu and Swine-flu, for the same reasons as above. The real numbers were once again much worse than the official governmental line.

\- They've made it illegal to speak negatively about the governmental response to the outbreak, and have been actively arresting people who are simply sharing the real story of what is happening. The maximum jail term for sharing information through non-government channels is 7 YEARS in jail. 7 YEARS!

\-The Chinese government is actively arresting people for ""leaking"" any real information via social media to other parts of the country, and the rest of the world. These arrests include front line medical personnel and doctors

\-They've quarantined over 60 million people, this is not a normal response for a low threat virus.

\-There have been hundreds (thousands?) of videos coming out of Wuhan showing hospitals overflowing with people, people dying in corridors, people being carried out of buildings in body bags etc. Doctors breaking down in tears over the disaster.

\- This Virus is having a huge financial impact on Chine both domestically and internationally, and situation the government will do just about anything to mitigate regardless of ethical considerations. There is ample historical evidence to consider this a factual statement.

\-The WHO has raised the threat level of this Virus multiple times for the initial assessment.

**Hearsay/anecdotal/non-official:**

\- Multiple experts in the WHO and virology field are reporting that they expect real infection numbers to be in the tens or hundreds of thousands.

\- Please keep in mind, all of these videos and reports and coming out DESPITE a huge governmental censorship and crackdown on social media, so it is reasonable to assume the reports would be orders of magnitude higher had China been a free and open democracy able to share this information free of consequence.

\- Medical professionals from multiple hospitals all reporting they are constantly running out of testing kits, medicine and having hundreds of people dying each day prior to even being tested and therefore not reported in official figures.

\- Multiple reports of crematoriums operating 24/7 throughout the province (previously operating only 4 hours a day), with bodies not even being identified correctly prior to being cremated.

\-Reports and videos for multiple sources of people waiting up to a WEEK to get tested for the virus, many of which are reported to have died at home and immediately cremated.

\-Percentages of foreigners having been evacuated from Wuhan showing the infection rate to be much higher than expected or reported from within China.

Videos and reports of people dying in lines waiting to be seen at hospitals, reports of massive social unrest within Wuhan and Hubei.

**The numbers:**

Firstly, i fully acknowledge that statistics can be manipulated and played with to suit almost any narrative. So I've deliberately tried to keep figures relatively conservative but still based on non-official sources as this whole exercise is about predicting the actual situation, not the CCP reported one.

Lets assume the 50 million number of people quarantined in Hubei is relatively accurate.

Keep in mind, this is just Hubei province, not the rest of China, or cases outside of China.

**ULTRA CONSERVATIVE**

.05% (only half of one percent) of people in quarantined area infected.

= 250,000 people infected.

Lethality of only 1%

= 2,500 dead

**CONSERVATIVE**

1% infection rate

= 500,000 cases

2% lethality (current official rate)

= 10,000 dead.

**SCARY BUT PLAUSIBLE**

5% infection rate

= 2,500,000 (2.5 million) cases

5% lethality

= 125,000 dead.

**SARS LETHALITY**

.05% Infection rate = 250,000 infected

SARS lethality (9.6%) = 24,000 dead

1% Infection rate = 500,000 infected

SARS lethality (9.6%) = 48,000 dead

5% Infection rate = 2,500,000 (2.5 million) cases

SARS lethality (9.6%) = 240,000 dead.

**WORTH REMEMBERING:**

These figures are ONLY for those in the quarantined zone, and do not include any of the provinces outside Hubei (which almost all are reporting cases of infection now) and does not include and statistics for cases internationally either.

I'm aware this is an exercise in playing with numbers, however i think it's not only justifiable and plausible to have this conversation, but that the government response by many nations leads one to think they may be a lot closer to reality than the official reports we have been getting in the media.

I'm happy to civilly discuss any of my above points. Stay safe people, wash your hands and have a wonderful day.

NOTHING! No alert, no airport lock down, no team to research the virus until how long? Oh right.. when other countries got infected. Then they shared that they have a not so big deal case in wuhan. 

So they jailed and kill anyone who knew about the virus until there was enough spread in the world and tried to blame U.S. military for it. Now you tell me you dont care about the chinese government?

Help desperately needed collecting Data on improvised/non-traditional PPE for COVID-19

Remember learning about how communities rallied to collect tinfoil, knit socks, roll bandages, etc. during WW2? THIS IS THE EQUIVALENT IN TODAY'S DIGITAL AGE. If you want to DO something NOW, THIS IS IT.

I REALLY need your help with this. PLEASE read through and if you have the capability right now, PLEASE consider helping. This has the potential to make a HUGE difference and I need help. Please SHARE THIS!

My friend Jack put it this way, ""COVID-19 may be able to pass through 3D printed plastic, or even just stay inside its porous surface. PLA, PETG, ABS, these are not medically safe plastics, let alone how problematic FDM printing as a method is for creating layer by layer seams that bacteria can hide in.

I desperately want to help too, but this isn’t how to do it. Don’t print masks. Don’t waste the plastic because no matter how dialed in your printer is, they’re not going to create a seal that can stop .12 microns, and even then the plastic itself will not stop the virus.""

From some of the data we're even starting to see that for some purposes, fabric masks can do more harm than good as well. What we REALLY need now is data collection. The best thing the 3D printing community can do to fight coronavirus right now is slice something fun, start it printing, and sit down and collect some data so we can put our efforts to solutions that will actually WORK while it prints.

We need volunteers to monitor hashtags on social media platforms (by first searching, then by following), to search and then monitor facebook groups, and to search on other areas of the internet.

&gt;A short while ago, I gave a brief statement to the press about our campaign, and where we go from here. I want to share some of those thoughts with you today, and to ask you, once again, for your financial support.

&gt;If you can do that now, please use this link to contribute $8...

&gt;Let me start by saying that last night was not a good night for our campaign from a delegate point of view.

&gt;We lost the largest state of the night, Michigan, but we won in North Dakota and currently lead in the state of Washington, the second largest state of the evening.

&gt;But what has become more and more apparent, with each passing primary, is that while we are currently trailing in the delegate count, we are strongly winning the debate about the future of our country.

&gt;In poll after poll after poll, including exit polls, a strong majority of the American people support our progressive agenda.

&gt;The American people are deeply concerned about the grotesque levels of income and wealth inequality in this country.

&gt;The American people believe it is time for the wealthy and profitable corporations to be paying their fair share.

&gt;The American people understand that the federal minimum wage is a starvation wage and that it is time to raise it to a living wage of $15 an hour – nothing less.

&gt;The American people understand that if our kids are going to make it into the middle class, we must make public colleges, universities and trade schools tuition free.

&gt;The American people understand that we cannot continue a cruel and dysfunctional health care system where we are spending twice as much per capita as any other nation, yet 87 million of our neighbors remain uninsured and underinsured.

&gt;And that last point is becoming more and more obvious to the American people as we face the challenge of the coronavirus. Imagine a pandemic where 87 million people have a difficult time going to a doctor.

&gt;The American people understand that climate change is an existential threat to our planet and we need to transform our energy system away from fossil fuels.

&gt;The American people understand that we need to transform our broken and racist criminal justice and immigration system that locks up four times as many people as communist China and leaves millions here at home living in fear.

&gt;But it is not just the ideological debate we are winning.

&gt;We are winning the generational debate as well.

&gt;While Joe Biden does well with older Americans, especially those over 65 years old, our campaign continues to win a vast majority of younger people in this country.

&gt;But while we are winning — very clearly — the ideological debate, we are losing, right now, the electability debate.

&gt;I cannot tell you how many people I and our campaign have spoken to that tell me that they like what our campaign stands for but they are going to vote for Joe Biden because they believe he is the best candidate to beat Trump.

&gt;Needless to say, I strongly disagree.

&gt;So, on Sunday, I very much look forward to debating Joe Biden about these issues in Arizona. This will be the first 1-on-1 debate of this campaign, and I am eager for the American people to see which candidate — which agenda — is best positioned to defeat Donald Trump, the most dangerous president in modern American history.

Bernard represents what people of all races and gender identities want. What most anyone would want: FREE MEDICAID FOR ALL. This alone would create a healthier population, a less stressful life, positive mental health. Bernie is for and always has been for the people. I will not succumb to the typical media spin, I will NOT vote for Joe Biden. If the DNC keeps fucking around, as the saying goes, they’re about to find out. Don’t underestimate the power of a revolution.

200," Government and RBA unite to save homes of virus-induced jobless

**The federal government has joined with the Reserve Bank to fire a ‘$105 billion bazooka’ into the business borrowing market and prevent foreclosures on mortgagees who lose their jobs as a result of the coronavirus crisis.** 

Banking changes to prevent the newly jobless losing their homes will be introduced after the federal government joined with the Reserve Bank to fire a “$105 billion bazooka” into the business borrowing market.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison­ said the government was working with banks to prevent foreclosures on customers who lost their jobs as a result of the coronavirus crisis.

Banking regulator APRA is letting major lenders eat into their capital buffers if it means people aren’t turfed out of their homes.

The PM added that temporary income support measures for laid-off workers would be part of a second round of government­ stimulus.

“We want to cushion the blow,” Mr Morrison said on Thursday night.

It’s believed that existing dole requirements, such as applying­ for jobs and attending relevant training, could be waived.

In a new bid to limit the economic and financial fallout, the RBA will provide big lenders with $90 billion of super-cheap money for loans to struggling small and medium enterprises (SMEs).

The RBA will also drive down the cost of bonds used to fund loans as part of a plan that sees the nation’s benchmark interest rate slashed to the lowest level possible.

Meanwhile the federal government will make a further $15 billion available to SMEs via smaller banks and other lenders.

“We have fired a $105 billion bazooka,” Treasurer Josh Frydenberg told The Daily Telegraph.

St George Bank chief economist­ Besa Deda said that “the various elements of this package reinforce one another and will help to lower funding costs across the economy and support the provision of credit, especially to businesses­”.

There was an immediate response to the moves, with the nation’s biggest bank, [CBA, cutting 1 per cent from business borrowing charges](https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/business/economy/rba-set-to-slash-cash-rate-to-new-record-low-as-coronavirus-rattles-australian-economy/news-story/ce5e8c3151be22e029b03b0c9a44af5e).

It also lifted its 12-month term deposit rate by 60 basis points.

“These are unprecedented times, and they call for unprecedented measures,” CommBank boss Matt Comyn said.

“We want to ensure that we help keep small businesses open so that they can keep Australians employed, and that we do everything we can to support households and older Australians.”

CBA also cut some fixed mortgage rates for new loans by 0.7 per cent.

But variable home loan rates were left untouched in the belief that customers would pocket rather than spend the saving.

So, in what CBA said was an attempt to bolster millions of households’ cashflow, it will instead automatically reduce all variable rate customers’ repayments to the minimum.

That will release $3.6 billion, CBA said.

After the RBA yesterday reduced its cash rate from 0.5 per cent to the lowest possible level of 0.25 per cent, Governor Philip Lowe said there would be no increase for at least three years.

And its vow to lower the key three-year bond rate had an immediate impact, producing a fall from 0.59 per cent to 0.35 per cent within half an hour.

Dr Lowe said the RBA was “prepared to transact in whatever quantities are needed” to get that rate down to 0.25 per cent and keep it there.

Australia was facing a “very serious situation” but would come through it, he said.

“At some point the virus will be contained and our economy and our financial markets will recover, and things will return to normal,” Dr Lowe said.

In the meantime the RBA was trying to provide low funding costs right across the economy, with a particular focus on SMEs.

“This is a priority issue for us,” he said. “Many small businesses are going to find coming months very difficult as their sales dry up and they support their staff.”

Deutsche Bank chief economist Phil O’Donaghoe said the RBA had delivered “the maximum possible effective stimulus to the Australian economy in the face of the unprecedented virus shock”.

CommSec chief economist Craig James said “maximum firepower” had been brought to bear.

It is not clear from the article what happened after that, and why it is still only a few hundreds of people being tested per day.  

The article mentioned that Roche testing is being used in China and Korea.   It may explain why Korea can conduct such massing testing of over 10,000 people a day, but I couldn't find direct source of connecting Roche to testing effort in Korea and China.

And, this study: First Case of 2019 Novel Coronavirus in the United States 

35 year old male - symptom progression day 1-12

https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001191


On January 19, 2020, a 35-year-old man presented to an urgent care clinic in Snohomish County, Washington, with a 4-day history of cough and subjective fever. On checking into the clinic, the patient put on a mask in the waiting room. After waiting approximately 20 minutes, he was taken into an examination room and underwent evaluation by a provider. He disclosed that he had returned to Washington State on January 15 after traveling to visit family in Wuhan, China. The patient stated that he had seen a health alert from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) about the novel coronavirus outbreak in China and, because of his symptoms and recent travel, decided to see a health care provider....

Given the patient’s travel history, the local and state health departments were immediately notified. Together with the urgent care clinician, the Washington Department of Health notified the CDC Emergency Operations Center. Although the patient reported that he had not spent time at the Huanan seafood market and reported no known contact with ill persons during his travel to China, CDC staff concurred with the need to test the patient for 2019-nCoV on the basis of current CDC “persons under investigation” case definitions.8 Specimens were collected in accordance with CDC guidance and included serum and nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens. After specimen collection, the patient was discharged to home isolation with active monitoring by the local health department.
On January 20, 2020, the CDC confirmed that the patient’s nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs tested positive for 2019-nCoV by real-time reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction (rRT-PCR) assay. In coordination with CDC subject-matter experts, state and local health officials, emergency medical services, and hospital leadership and staff, the patient was admitted to an airborne-isolation unit at Providence Regional Medical Center for clinical observation, with health care workers following CDC recommendations for contact, droplet, and airborne precautions with eye protection.

On admission, the patient reported persistent dry cough and a 2-day history of nausea and vomiting; he reported that he had no shortness of breath or chest pain. Vital signs were within normal ranges. On physical examination, the patient was found to have dry mucous membranes. The remainder of the examination was generally unremarkable. After admission, the patient received supportive care, including 2 liters of normal saline and ondansetron for nausea.


On days 2 through 5 of hospitalization (days 6 through 9 of illness), the patient’s vital signs remained largely stable, apart from the development of intermittent fevers accompanied by periods of tachycardia (Figure 2). The patient continued to report a nonproductive cough and appeared fatigued. On the afternoon of hospital day 2, the patient passed a loose bowel movement and reported abdominal discomfort. A second episode of loose stool was reported overnight; a sample of this stool was collected for rRT-PCR testing, along with additional respiratory specimens (nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal) and serum. The stool and both respiratory specimens later tested positive by rRT-PCR for 2019-nCoV, whereas the serum remained negative.

Treatment during this time was largely supportive. For symptom management, the patient received, as needed, antipyretic therapy consisting of 650 mg of acetaminophen every 4 hours and 600 mg of ibuprofen every 6 hours. He also received 600 mg of guaifenesin for his continued cough and approximately 6 liters of normal saline over the first 6 days of hospitalization.


A chest radiograph taken on hospital day 3 (illness day 7) was reported as showing no evidence of infiltrates or abnormalities (Figure 3). However, a second chest radiograph from the night of hospital day 5 (illness day 9) showed evidence of pneumonia in the lower lobe of the left lung (Figure 4). These radiographic findings coincided with a change in respiratory status starting on the evening of hospital day 5, when the patient’s oxygen saturation values as measured by pulse oximetry dropped to as low as 90% while he was breathing ambient air. On day 6, the patient was started on supplemental oxygen, delivered by nasal cannula at 2 liters per minute. Given the changing clinical presentation and concern about hospital-acquired pneumonia, treatment with vancomycin (a 1750-mg loading dose followed by 1 g administered intravenously every 8 hours) and cefepime (administered intravenously every 8 hours) was initiated.


On hospital day 6 (illness day 10), a fourth chest radiograph showed basilar streaky opacities in both lungs, a finding consistent with atypical pneumonia (Figure 5), and rales were noted in both lungs on auscultation. Given the radiographic findings, the decision to administer oxygen supplementation, the patient’s ongoing fevers, the persistent positive 2019-nCoV RNA at multiple sites, and published reports of the development of severe pneumonia3,4 at a period consistent with the development of radiographic pneumonia in this patient, clinicians pursued compassionate use of an investigational antiviral therapy. Treatment with intravenous remdesivir (a novel nucleotide analogue prodrug in development10,11) was initiated on the evening of day 7, and no adverse events were observed in association with the infusion. Vancomycin was discontinued on the evening of day 7, and cefepime was discontinued on the following day, after serial negative procalcitonin levels and negative nasal PCR testing for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

On hospital day 8 (illness day 12), the patient’s clinical condition improved. Supplemental oxygen was discontinued, and his oxygen saturation values improved to 94 to 96% while he was breathing ambient air. The previous bilateral lower-lobe rales were no longer present. His appetite improved, and he was asymptomatic aside from intermittent dry cough and rhinorrhea. 

As of January 30, 2020, the patient remains hospitalized. He is afebrile, and all symptoms have resolved with the exception of his cough, which is decreasing in severity.

We don't have that fail safe. By making 1 and 2 inaccessible to poor people they've limited the amount of testing available and set up these centers in wealthy areas at least a 1 hour drive for poorer communities. This is a disaster with no cultural fail safe waiting to happen.



Societal philosophy response to ""corruption"" and ""poverty"" (irrelevant to coronavirus): 

Personally, I've found corruption tied to one thing across all societies: how well you pay military and police officers. 

Poverty is a lot more complicated and each country I've visited has different reasons for their poor. But the most interesting thing I've learned is that happiness and poverty are NOT correlated. Poor people in SE Asia are happy. Poor people in USA are not. The loosely common theme is that a class system where the poor can take pride in the menial jobs is a happy one.

Checks would fall to $600 for those with little or no income tax liability. They'd throw in $500 per child. Eligibility would be based on 2018 tax filings, which may leave out people who have suddenly lost their job.

A bill meant to help people who have lost their job currently due to the coronavirus being meant for people in a sub 100k a year income bracket with more toward less than 75k.   What is your “regular person” definition, most Americans earn around 60k a year.   Seems like that would benefit most working adults to me.   

So if you don’t have a job and didn’t back in 2018 you might be receiving other benefits like welfare, Medicaid, snap, etc.

&gt; The Budget Statement will be delivered later today, Feb. 18., by Deputy Prime Minister (DPM) and Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat.

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; Budget 2020 to include measures against Covid-19 economic impacts

&gt; Budget 2020 is likely to detail measures to help Singaporeans to cope with the economic impact of Covid-19 outbreak which was “not on the table one month ago”.

&gt; As such, Heng revealed in a Facebook post that the officers at the Finance Ministry have also been spending extra hours, working through the night with him to come up with updated and targeted support measures in view of the new development.

&gt; “The Ministry of Finance (Singapore) team has been putting in extra hours to track the fast-evolving situation, listening to Singaporeans’ suggestions, and coming up with targeted support measures. We have many young officers at MOF, and I had really hoped that they could have a nice Valentine’s Day with their loved ones last Friday. Instead, they asked for understanding from their partners, and worked with me through the night and over the weekend.”

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; Dedicates a post to MOF’s ‘Porridge Auntie’

&gt; It’s not just the MOF team that’s working hard on Budget 2020.

&gt; Heng also wrote a post to thank one “Porridge Auntie” who stayed back with the staff to ensure they were not working with empty stomachs.

&gt; Heng explained that dinner was usually catered for staff in the lead-up to the Budget, as the team would be working “late into the night”, ahead of the big day. However, dinner on the day before the Budget Statement would be when staffers from the Ministry of Finance (MOF) observed a long-standing tradition, involving a hot bowl of comforting porridge.

&gt; Heng’s post included a photo of a bowl of that porridge, topped with youtiao, egg, century egg, fishcake, and garnished with shallots and Chinese parsley.

&gt; Describing it as “a treat and comfort food”, Heng called it “the equivalent of MOF’s annual ‘reunion dinner’”.

&gt; Heng shared that the “tasty and nutritious pre-Budget porridge” was prepared by a long-serving member of MOF’s staff known as Auntie Mei Jok, who cooked the porridge as a “labour of love” which had “[nourished] the spirits and stomachs of countless MOF colleagues”.

&gt; Heng also credited “many colleagues including Flora, Lillian, and Geok Lian”, who helped with the preparations.

&gt; According to Heng, the pre-Budget porridge meal has been a yearly tradition that was observed even before MOF moved to The Treasury building at High Street in 1997.

&gt; Reactions from Facebook users

&gt; This is possibly one of the most well-received posts by Heng so far.

&gt; Heng’s post not only drew over 4,000 reactions, comments, and shares, but also whetted many Facebook users’ appetites:

&gt; Some drew a parallel between the pre-Budget meal and the Budget itself:

&gt; (“有粥吃粥, 有饭吃饭” is a colloquial saying literally translated to “when there’s porridge, eat porridge, and when there’s rice, eat rice”, implying that one should be contented with whatever life brings them.)

&gt; Facebook users also echoed Heng’s thanks to Auntie Mei Jok and her colleagues for their previously unseen work behind the scenes.

&gt; You can see the post here:

&gt; Budget 2020

&gt; There will be live television and radio coverage of the Budget Statement.

&gt; In addition, a live webcast of the delivery will be available on the Singapore Budget website.

&gt; For real-time updates, you can follow MOF’s Facebook page and Twitter account. The full Budget Statement will be published on the Singapore Budget website after delivery.

211,"&gt; # Wuhan virus: Singapore expands travel ban to all China visitors

&gt; SINGAPORE — All China passport holders not residing in Singapore will be barred from entering or transiting through Singapore, the Multi-Ministry Taskforce on the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak announced on Friday (31 January).

&gt; With immediate effect, the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) will suspend the issuance of all forms of new visas to those with China passports. Singapore’s status as a visa-free transit facility for those with China passports will also be suspended.

&gt; Previously issued short-term and multiple-visit visas for those with China passports will also be suspended. During this period of suspension, they will not be allowed entry into Singapore.

&gt; All new visitors with recent travel history to mainland China within the last 14 days will not be allowed to enter or transit through Singapore, said the Taskforce.

&gt; Returning Singaporeans and long-term visa pass holders with similar recent travel history will be allowed to enter, but they will have to get 14 days of Leave of Absence (LOA) upon returning. 

&gt; The curbs will take effect on Saturday at 23.59pm.

&gt; The latest moves would enable the authorities to limit the number of imported cases and reduce the risk of community spread, said National Development Minister Lawrence Wong, co-chair of the Taskforce, at a media briefing on Friday (31 January). 

&gt; To date, there is no evidence of community spread of the virus, he added. 

&gt; The new curbs were announced less than a day after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a “public health emergency of international concern”. The declaration sets the stage for global coordinated efforts to deal with the outbreak.

&gt; WHO believes that it is still possible to interrupt the spread of the virus, provided that countries implement strong response measures, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said in a statement.

&gt; “While the majority of confirmed cases in China are still linked to Hubei province, MOH understands that there is a growing possibility that more individuals from other parts of China may be infected with the virus. Significantly, the virus has spread to every region of mainland China,” MOH said.

&gt; On Thursday, the MOH confirmed three more cases of the Wuhan coronavirus in Singapore, bringing the total tally in the Republic to 13.

&gt; All 13 confirmed cases are Chinese nationals, of whom at least 11 are residents of Wuhan, where the virus originated.

&gt; The coronavirus, or 2019-nCoV, has spread to 22 territories beyond mainland China, sickening close to 10,000 people – surpassing figures for the 2002-2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak – and claiming 213 lives to date.

&gt; On Tuesday, the Taskforce announced a set of travel curbs specific to visitors with recent travel history to Hubei province, home to Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak. 

&gt; There is a travel ban in place for new visitors with recent travel history to Hubei within the last 14 days, since Wednesday. Such individuals are not allowed to enter or transit through Singapore

&gt; This also applies to those with Chinese passports issued in Hubei. For such travellers, there is a suspension on issuance of all new visas, previously-issued short-term and multiple-visit visas, and visa-free transit facilities. The ban applies to land, sea and air travel.

&gt; Returning Singaporeans, permanent residents and long-term pass holders with travel history to Hubei in the last 14 days will be quarantined, as will returning permanent residents and long-term pass holders with Chinese passports issued in Hubei.

212,"China to free my friend, Mark Swidan. 

He has been detained at the Jiangmen Detention Center for over 7+ years on drug trafficking charges. China makes it a common practice to detain U.S. Citizens, without any proof of their accusations. 

He is the longest detained American Citizen in China, without being sentenced or sent to prison! 
Why? 
Because they know he is innocent, like many others do, and they have kept him as a pawn for leverage over the  U.S. Trade Negotiations and South China Sea. 

Google Mark Swidan, and read the credible and fact checked articles from Newsweek and duihua.org. 


There is no evidence and met the men, actually involved with the drug trafficking, through a ""friend"" in Houston, TX. This ""friend"" knew he was going to China, and so kindly made the introduction to an ""interpreter"" and ""driver"". This ""friend"" is involved with the drug trafficking as well. 

There is proof he was there for business purposes, which the Chinese High Court won't allow into evidence. 
Mark Swidan had  nothing to do with this, and had zero knowledge of anything drug related. 


He's been starved, tortured, shackled, beaten, has slept on a cold concrete floor, and used for slave labor for over 7 years. All detainees or prisoners, in China, are forced to make the plastic flowers and Christmas ornaments that WE ALL BUY from Walmart and Hobby Lobby! 

What would you do if this happened to your son, daughter, mother, father, friend, husband, wife, or you?!?!?!

Help a fellow U.S. Citizen, with no criminal background, come home! Write to the State Department and Senators, especially TX Senators, and demand they take action to bring him home. 

President Trump did it for NCAA basketball players, who were actually guilty of breaking the law, but he hasn't done anything for Mark Swidan. 

Great sound bites, from Sec of State and other U.S. government officials, criticizing China for their lack of Human Rights and Due Process, but NO ACTION! 


Now, there's the Corona Virus outbreak, right around the area he is being detained. China detains anyone, for whatever reason. Don't forget, they are a dictatorship and communist country. He could catch this, and they would just let him die! 

Help Mark Swidan come back home to Houston, TX, and allow this innocent man the ability to start a life again, after much needed healthcare, PTSD care, dental care, sleep on a real bed, and a real meal, without dog meat. 

My name is Lina Lou, and I know he is innocent. I bet my own life on it, and I truly mean it 1000%. 

Only our government can get him home. 

Only U.S. Citizens can make them do it, especially during this 2020 election year.

                                        March 11, 2020

Dear Parents,

 

As new developments and guidelines are shared by the Center of Disease Control (CDC), the California Department of Public Health (CDPH), San Francisco Public Health Department (SFDPH), and the California Department of Education (CDE), we continue to monitor TECA’s current situation and take safety precautions based on the guidance from these organizations. All decisions made at TECA are in alignment with the guidance provided from CDC, CDPH, SFDPH, and CDE.  

 

Yesterday, we informed you that a family had been exposed to a person who tested positive for COVID-19. Many questions came to us regarding the grade levels the children are in, whether they were in school when they were exposed to the person, whether they have tested positive for COVID-19, and whether there is an outbreak on campus. 

 

To answer your questions, the children are in grades K, 2nd and 8th. The children were here last week. The parent did not know there was any possible exposure last week. The parent contacted the school Monday and did not send the children to school.  Administrators verified information with the family and consulted with SFDPH to identify next steps based on their recommendations. The family was advised to quarantine themselves for 14 days. The parent has contacted their medical provider and is monitoring any occurrence of symptoms. No one in the family shows symptoms of COVID-19. They have not tested positive for COVID-19. The parent will contact the principal immediately if any conditions change and confirms daily that family members are showing no symptoms.  No, there is not an outbreak of COVID-19 at TECA and no one on site has tested positive for COVID-19. 

 

GUIDANCE FOR SCHOOLS

I. From the SF Public Department of Health

 

If there is a confirmed case of COVID-19 at a school, SFDPH will work with the school to determine the best measures including potential school closure. In addition, SFDPH recommends for schools. 

 

Do not go to school if sick. Any student or staff member who is sick should not report to school. Any students who appear sick, we are calling families to pick up their children immediately. 

If you have a child with chronic health conditions, consult your doctor about school attendance. If your child has a respiratory condition or any other health issues, you need to contact your medical provider to take the necessary precautions if your child has been in any public place (school, stores, movie theaters, parks, public transportation, etc.) and consider keeping them at home. 

 Equip all schools and classrooms with hand sanitizers and tissues. All classrooms have been equipped with hand sanitizer, tissue, disinfectant wipes, disinfectant spray, and soap. In addition, our custodial staff are taking extensive measures to disinfect school facilities on a daily (and hourly if necessary) basis according to the CDC guidance.

Recommend rescheduling or cancelling medium to large events that are not essential. All non-essential events have been canceled small, medium, and large.

Explore remote teaching and online options to continue learning. The teachers at TECA are in the process of providing packets and online options for continued learning. Please contact your child’s teacher for specifics.

Schools should develop a plan for citywide school closures, and families should prepare for potential closures.  We are constantly monitoring the health status of students, staff, and families; and monitoring updated guidelines provided by SFDPH, CDPH, and CDE. 

 

II.        From the California Department of Public Health and California Department of 

            Education

 

Many of you are asking why aren’t we closing the school. On March 7, 2020, the CDPH and CDE sent guidance on COVID-19. “If one student, teacher or staff member tests positive for COVID-19 and exposed other at the school, CDPH recommends…in consultation with the local public health department, the appropriate school official may consider if school closure is warranted and length of time based on the risk level within the specific community as determined by the local public health officer”

 

We are a public charter school and we are following guidelines given to us by the California Department of Education. As of March 7th, if a California public school has closed, it’s more likely they have at least one student, teacher, or staff member test positive for COVID-19. Private and Catholic Schools have their own guidelines and are not subject to those provided by CDE. 








 

KEEP YOURSELF INFORMED

Please access any of the following links if you want to understand the guidance schools and school districts are provided. We follow the recommendations of the...

 SF Department of Public Health (sfdph.org)

California Department of Public Health (cdph.ca.gov)

Center for Disease Control and Prevention (cdc.gov)

California Department of Education (cde.ca.gov)

 

Please be reminded that we are all in the process of navigating this challenging and scary time, as a result, we all react differently to the uncertainty of COVID-19. We all take this situation seriously and as TECA administration, we must always remain calm. We are here to listen/ understand your concerns and will address your questions, recommendations, and feedback accordingly. 


 

TIMELY INFORMATION

Our goal is to provide families and staff timely information regarding COVID-19 and how it impacts TECA.  In the event we are informed that a student, teacher, or staff member tests positive for COVID-19, we will dismiss school immediately and follow up with next steps via Bright Arrow and Auto-Dial. As soon as we hear information our next steps are to  find out all of the facts and consult with SFPDH. We understand that the uncertainty of COVID-19 causes anxiety, frustration, and panic. However, we all respond differently to uncertainty. Please note that we take this situation seriously and all of us want to feel safe from COVID-19. 

 

Thank you for your support and keeping our community safe. 

 

Sincerely,

214,"Even, the original, unmodified version is clearly just being misread.

&gt;This applies especially if you are staying in a country with poorly developed health services and infrastructure and/or collective infrastructure, such as the USA.

In logic this would be: Return home if: (the country has poorly developed health services and infrastructure) OR (the country has poorly developed collective infrastructure).

And we have to dig into ""collective infrastructure"" which, to Norwegians, mostly means public transit.

If you go read the same University's website, the re-written version confirms this reading:

&gt;This applies especially if you are staying in a country with poorly developed health services. This also applies for countries with poorly developed collective infrastructure, for example the USA, where it can be difficult to get to the airport if you don't have a car.

2. India is the only country in the world to evacuate its citizens 6 times (and counting) and evacuated the most number of foreign nationals. 

3. The Indian Air Force evacuated a total of 723 Indians, 37 foreign nationals from Wuhan. India evacuated 119 Indians and 5 foreign nationals from Japan. IAF also evacuated 58 Indian pilgrims from Iran on the 10th of March. Total: 900 Indians and 48 foreign nationals.

4. India is leading the fight against COVID-19 in the South Asian region, offering diplomatic, humanitarian and medical assistance to its neighbours.

5. A total of 56 Virus Research Diagnostic Laboratories (VRDLs) have been set up in India to test its citizens as well as foreign citizens in a record time, with a plan to build 56 more VRDLs in the next month. This insane level of efficiency hasn't caught the eye of the media.

6. India currently has one of the world’s most efficient and reliable testing systems, reducing the time taken to get test results back from 12-14 hours to four hours. US health officials have admitted that their system is failing and has testing has been very sluggish.

7. As a result, from Iran, Afghanistan up to Timor Leste, countries in Asia have been requesting India to help set up testing facilities in their countries.

8. India has sent 6 top scientists to set up a make-shift lab and testing facility in Iran to test 6000 of its citizens because Iranian officials refused to test Indians due to their high load. India plans to send 3 more airplanes in the next week to airlift its citizens.

9. India has provided 15 tonnes of medical assistance comprising masks, gloves and other emergency medical equipment to China.

10. India has sent Maldives a 14 member medical team comprising of pulmonologists, anaesthetists, physicians &amp; lab technicians and also a large composite of COVID-19 medical relief to assist Maldives health authorities.

11. India has screened 1,057,506 people from 30 airports and 77 seaports.

12. India has suspended all visas to India as well as visa-free travel facility for OCI cardholders. It has closed its border with Myanmar. The Indian nationals coming from COVID-19 hit nations after 15 February will be quarantined for 14 days. This in contrast with the UK with far more cases but no quick action whatsoever.

13. India has the world’s biggest state-sponsored health assurance scheme, covering over 500 million beneficiaries (approximately 8 times the size of the UK).

14. Indian drug prices are among the cheapest in the world. Medbelle ranks India as one of the five countries with the lowest median prices for drugs around the world due to an elaborate price control mechanism for drugs and the government’s Jan Aushadi project to provide cheap affordable medicines to the poor.

15. China had silenced the doctor who identified COVID-19 and he died 6 weeks later. China let this brew. On the other hand, when Nipah virus was found in India in 2018, 3 doctors identified it and authorities immediately reported it to WHO. 2000 quarantined and 17 died in total.
India would have NEVER allowed it to become a pandemic.

The Indian civilization, being one of the most advanced in the world, has been way ahead of its time with gifting the world the Namaste- which is now propagated by every world leader. Ancient India idealised vegetarianism and expounded Ayurveda, and as a result, did not come in contact with any serious threat from plagues/ diseases in its millenniums of existence.

217,"Dr. Xia, too, was severely ill, but appeared to be slowly fighting the infection. Her fever had subsided after a few days, and she began to breathe more easily after being attached to a ventilator.

Her spirits lifted. On Jan. 25, she told her colleagues she was recovering.

“💪💪💪💪💪💪 I will return to the team soon,” she texted them on WeChat.

“We need you the most,” one of her colleagues responded.

In early February, Dr. Xia asked her husband, Wu Shilei, also a doctor, whether he thought she could get off oxygen therapy soon.

“Take it easy. Don’t be too anxious,” he replied on WeChat. He told her that the ventilator could possibly be removed by the following week.

“I keep on thinking about getting better soon,” Dr. Xia responded.

There was reason to believe she was on the mend. After all, most coronavirus patients recover.

Later, Dr. Xia tested negative twice for the coronavirus. She told her mother she expected to be discharged on Feb. 8.

Decline
Day 4 to 16 after hospitalization



 In the hospital, Ms. Deng’s only contacts were her roommate and the medical staff. She added a caption to a photo with her doctor, saying laughter would help chase the illness away. Two tests indicated that Dr. Xia was free of the virus, but her condition suddenly deteriorated.

By Ms. Deng’s fourth day in the hospital, she could no longer pretend to be cheerful. She was vomiting, having diarrhea and relentlessly shivering.

Her fever jumped to 101.3 degrees. Early in the morning on Feb. 5, she woke from a fitful sleep to find the medicine had done nothing to lower her temperature. She cried. She said she was classified as critically ill.

The next day, she threw up three times, until she was left spitting white bubbles. She felt she was hallucinating. She could not smell or taste, and her heart rate slowed to about 50 beats per minute.

On a phone call, Ms. Deng’s mother tried to reassure her that she was young and otherwise healthy, and that the virus would pass like a bad cold. But Ms. Deng feared otherwise. “I felt like I was walking on the edge of death,” she wrote in a social media post from her hospital bed the next day.

China defines a critically ill patient as someone with respiratory failure, shock or organ failure. Around 5 percent of infected patients became critical in China, according to one of the largest studies to date of coronavirus cases. Of those, 49 percent died. (Those rates may eventually change once more cases are examined around the world.)

While Dr. Xia appeared to be recovering, she was still terrified of dying. Testing can be faulty, and negative results don’t necessarily mean patients are in the clear.

She asked her mother for a promise: Could her parents look after her 2-year-old son if she didn’t make it?

Hoping to dispel her anxiety with humor, her mother, Jiang Wenyan, chided her: “He’s your own son. Don’t you want to raise him yourself?”

Dr. Xia also worried about her husband. Over video chat, she urged him to put on protective equipment at the hospital where he worked. “She said she would wait for me to return safely,” he said, “and go to the frontline again with me when she recovered.”

Then came the call. Dr. Xia’s condition had suddenly deteriorated. In the early hours of Feb. 7, her husband rushed to the emergency room.

Her heart had stopped.

Recovery
Day 17 after hospitalization


After being discharged, Ms. Deng briefly got to see her mother, who had been working at the hospital during her illness. She then went home to isolate herself for two weeks.
In most cases, the body repairs itself. The immune system produces enough antibodies to clear the virus, and the patient recovers.

By the end of Ms. Deng’s first week in the hospital, her fever had receded. She could eat the food her mother delivered. On Feb. 10, as her appetite returned, she looked up photos of meat skewers online and posted them wishfully to social media.

On Feb. 15, her throat swab came back negative for the virus. Three days later, she tested negative again. She could go home.

Ms. Deng met her mother briefly at the hospital’s entrance. Then, because Wuhan remained locked down, without taxis or public transportation, she walked home alone.

“I felt like a little bird,” she recalled. “My freedom had been returned to me.”

She had to isolate at home for 14 days. Her husband and daughter stayed with her parents.

At home, she threw out her clothing, which she had been wearing for her entire time in the hospital.

Since then, she has passed the time by playing with her cats and watching television. She jokes that she is getting an early taste of retirement. She does daily deep breathing exercises to strengthen her lungs, and her cough has faded.

The Chinese government has urged recovered patients to donate plasma, which experts say contains antibodies that could be used to treat the sick. Ms. Deng contacted a local blood bank soon after getting home.

She plans to go back to work as soon as the hospital allows it.

“It was the nation that saved me,” she said. “And I think I can pay it back to the nation.”

Death
Day 35 after hospitalization


On Dr. Xia’s desk at work, her colleagues left 1,000 paper cranes — a Chinese symbol of hope and blessings. Written on the wings was a message: “Rest in peace, we will use our lives to continue this relay race and prevail over this epidemic.”
It was sometime after 3 a.m. on Feb. 7 when Dr. Xia was rushed to intensive care. Doctors first intubated her. Then, the president of the hospital frantically summoned several experts from around the city, including Dr. Peng Zhiyong, head of the department of critical care at Zhongnan Hospital.

They called every major hospital in Wuhan to borrow an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or Ecmo, machine to do the work of her heart and lungs.

Dr. Xia’s heart started beating again. But the infection in her lungs was too severe, and they failed. Her brain was starved of oxygen, causing irreversible damage. Soon, her kidneys shut down and doctors had to put her on round-the-clock dialysis.

“The brain acts as the control center,” Dr. Peng said. “She couldn’t command her other organs, so those organs would fail. It was only a matter of time.”

Dr. Xia slipped into a coma. She died on Feb. 23.

Dr. Peng remains baffled about why Dr. Xia died after she had seemed to improve. Her immune system, like that of many health workers, may have been compromised by constant exposure to sickness. Perhaps she suffered from what experts call a “cytokine storm,” in which the immune system’s reaction to a new virus engulfs the lungs with white blood cells and fluid. Perhaps she died because her organs were starved of oxygen.

Back at Dr. Xia’s home, her son, Jiabao — which means priceless treasure — still thinks his mother is working. When the phone rings, he tries to grab it from his grandmother’s hands, shouting: “Mama, mama.”

Her husband, Dr. Wu, doesn’t know what to tell Jiabao. He hasn’t come to terms with her death himself. They had met in medical school and were each other’s first loves. They had planned to grow old together.

“I loved her very much,” he said. “She’s gone now. I don’t know what to do in the future, I can only hold on.”",0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0

219,"HANOI/BANGKOK, Feb 12 (Reuters) - Cambodia has agreed to let a cruise ship that has been turned away by five countries over fears that someone aboard may have the coronavirus dock and disembark its passengers, the Holland America Line said on Wednesday.
For nearly two weeks, the MS Westerdam, a ship of healthy passengers, had been sailing throughout Asia after being turned away by Japan, Taiwan, Guam and the Philippines over fears that someone on the cruise could have the new flu-like virus that has killed more than 1,100 people, almost all of them in China.

“We will immediately begin making our way to Sihanoukville in Cambodia,” Westerdam captain Vincent Smit told passengers, according to a recording of the announcement reviewed by Reuters.
“There will be a brief health inspection on board by the Cambodian authorities which will take place at anchor just before we arrive alongside,” said Smit.
The ship is expected to arrive in Cambodia around 7 a.m. (0000 GMT) on Thursday, he said.

The latest country to shun the ship, which has 1,455 passengers and 802 crew on board, had been Thailand, where the health minister refused to grant the Westerdam permission to dock.
“The staff has tried to bolster spirits but you can only play so many games of trivia,” Angela Jones, a business consultant from the U.S. state of Georgia, told Reuters in a video recording sent before the news that Cambodia would take the ship. “I’ve asked others who say they are napping a lot.”

Like many on board, Jones had embarked in Hong Kong for a much-anticipated cruise through the region in early February. It was scheduled to be a two-week cruise, but with that period running out this week, there had been worries about fuel and food supplies. Many on board are elderly and there was also concerns they could be running out of medicines.
To kill time and break up the monotony of endless ocean scrolling past cabin windows, the ship’s crew have organised dozens of activities to keep people occupied, tourists on board the vessel told Reuters.

People could be seen playing chess and doing puzzles on Wednesday, in some of the first pictures published by media of life aboard the ship.
Other activities on offer included colouring-in for adults; teeth whitening; poker tournaments; whisky tasting; even a lecture on modern China which delved into the economics of collective farming, according to passengers on board and a copy of the ship’s activity programme seen by Reuters.
Passengers on board the ship have been subjected to regular health checks, according to Holland America, the ship operator and a unit of Miami-based Carnival Corp. There have been no reported cases of the coronavirus on board.

Stoking fears of authorities in countries on the ship’s route has been the ongoing quarantine in Japan of the Diamond Princess cruise ship, also managed by a unit of Carnival Corp. A total of 175 out of the 3,700 people on board the Diamond Princess have tested positive for the coronavirus.
Late on Wednesday, the Westerdam changed its course away from Bangkok and began heading towards Cambodia, according to data published by the Marine Traffic ship tracking website.

Earlier, the Thai Navy “Bhumibol Adulyadej” warship could be seen escorting the Westerdam in waters just off the Thai coast, according to passengers and Marine Traffic.
Despite the uncertainty, crew members had staged a farewell ceremony for passengers on Wednesday morning, singing to the tune of the 1979 hit “We Are Family” by Sister Sledge.

Elsewhere on board, the patience of some passengers has been tested by the prolonged uncertainty, Jones said, as some people pushed and shoved for access to one of the ship’s only available computers and printers, to re-book flights home.
“Hard to imagine these senior cruisers coming to blows but guess that happened,” said Jones. “It’s funny and sad at the same time”.

220,"It’s a method called rRT-PCR.  This test(assay) that the cdc developed targets 3 different regions of the 2019-nCoV genome.  The Coronavirus has a RNA genome (like influenza and other respiratory viruses).  

The viral RNA is extracted from upper or lower respiratory specimens like nasal/throat swabs or sputum.  An enzyme called reverse transcriptase is used to transcribe the 3 targeted regions of the Coronavirus from RNA in to DNA.  

Then PCR is performed on the resulting complementary DNA.  PCR is using an enzyme called Taq Polymerase and short strands of synthetic DNA called primers and probes to amplify the DNA.  The probes contain a fluorescent molecule that gets released when the DNA is replicated.  When it is released, it fluoresces, and that image is capture by a camera on the instrument.

A real-time PCR instrument is basically an oven that can heat up/cool down quickly, with a light source to excite the fluorescent molecule and a camera to detect the emission.  Both reverse transcription and PCR are temperature sensitive reactions hence the oven component of the instrument.  

Once there have been enough copies of DNA amplified the fluorescent signal generated from the probes is intense enough to cross a threshold setting.  If the signal for all 3 targets of the Coronavirus genome crosses the threshold, then a patient is considered positive for the virus.  

PCR is an exponential reaction, making it very sensitive and able to detect just a few copies of a viruses genome.  This is the same method used for CDC’s influenza surveillance (but the reagents are different).  

A big hurdle with getting the cdc’s assay in to labs across the United Sates is the time required to design the assay, order reagents for it, verify the assay, manufacture test kits, and get approval from the FDA for an emergency use authorization (EUA).  An EUA is basically allowing the use of this test without it being FDA validated.  FDA validation is a multi year process so an EUA is issued for emergent public health issues.

[The CDC has their protocol on their website:](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/rt-pcr-detection-instructions.html)

221,"Two important takeaways:

“I don’t think we’re dealing with the flu here. WHO, who has looked at this virus most intensively, who has looked extremely closely at the experience in China, who has looked at the mortality rates in China, and has tried to estimate whether there’s a lot of undercounting in China, does not feel like we’re seeing the tip of the iceberg, as Bruce who led that expedition said we’re seeing the pyramid, actually. They think the mortality rate is higher than 1%, which, even if it were 1%, would be 10x deadlier than the average rate of your seasonal flu, and because this is a virus that is now circulating in a population that has absolutely no immunity to it, you would expect the attack rates to be much higher than the attack rates that we normally see with the seasonal flu. You might have an attack rate that’s 3x higher than seasonal flu with a mortality rate that’s at least 10x higher. The most concerning thing about this virus is the combination of infectiousness and the ability to cause severe disease or death. We have not since 1918, the Spanish flu, seen a virus that combined those two qualities in the same way. We have seen very lethal viruses; but those viruses have high mortality rates. Ebola’s mortality rate in some settings is greater than 80%, but they don’t have the infectiousness that this virus has. They don’t have the potential to explode and spread globally. I don’t want to make predictions, because I think what happens with this virus is up to us. I do think this virus has the potential to cause a global pandemic if we’re not already there, and I do think the virus has demonstrated that it has a lethality that is likely many fold higher than normal flu. In some respects, if it’s between 1% and 3.4% it really doesn’t matter what’s after the decimal point. I think what we’re seeing is a virus that is many many times more lethal than flu, in right now a population that’s completely vulnerable to it and that we’re seeing it’s ability to explode.”

“One challenge that we face is that people who are young and generally healthy won’t perceive (social) risk and they’ll govern their behavior based on what they perceive their personal risk to be. I think we need to start thinking in terms of the social risk. I’m generally healthy, I’m not that concerned about my own personal risk, but if I then felt well enough to go to work and I go to work and I shake hands with my older colleague who’s got a chronic medical condition, I could be responsible for that colleague’s death. I think we all need to think about our responsibility to each other as we think about how we’re going to govern our behavior. We can’t view the epidemic in terms of our personal risk, we need to act collectively in a cooperative manner. One of the things that Bruce has talked about from the WHO coming back from the investigation in China is the degree to which the Chinese people have been mobilized against the virus. He put it in terms of it is like they are at war with the virus, all of society is mobilized in the fight against the virus.”",0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0

That's a very legitimate question to ask.

224,"Unlikely.  Once it infects a cell, it will eject its babies which spread interstitially, and are picked up by the lymph system, and spread to lymph nodes.  Also, the virus can infect any type of epithelium, including blood vessels.  In other words, no matter where you start it growing, it eventually spreads throughout the body.  This is why SARS-COV-2 is not just pneumogenic, but can also cause sepsis.

The only practical way of inoculating against it would be to have damaged versions, such as if you had a vat of it, lysed them all, destroyed the rna, and separated out the protein coat fragments, then injected those.  They would still bind, and cause a local reaction, which would be detected, and trigger an immune response; however, they would not be able to replicate, since there would be no mRNA.  It might take several inoculations to confer immunity.

I think the current proto-vaccine includes viral fragments that encode only for the spike, that have been synthesized.  They are first testing to make sure people don't have some horrible side effect from the new vaccine, and then they will test to see if people actually get immunity from it.  Once that's done, they'll work on mass producing it.

Another thing being thrown around is blood serum.  People with immunity will contain reminder tags in the blood, which remind the immune system how to react to this virus if it happens again.  Those reminders can be used to pre-warn other peoples' immune systems in some cases.  That's still yet to be tested here.

There may be other types of inoculations that confer immunity, but full power, live virus, anywhere in the body, would not be the way to go.

225,"The current numbers that we have from Italy aren't accurate either. If it is to be believed that +80% of the cases are mild then most people infected will likely never seek medical assistance in the first place. 

You can obviously question the 80% figure too but as far as what we currently know, almost everything is uncertain.

Eitherway, using such an extreme example to propagate the fact that the mortality rate is sitting at +30% is a blatant misuse of statistics to push an agenda. 

The vast majority of people who died in Italy are over the age of 80 according to the country's own reporting. Most cases are mild. Out of the 11 cases in Sweden (reported currently), 10 are in good condition according to the swedish health ministry. In Korea the mortality rate is way lower than China's sitting at below 1%. While we don't have much information on the current coronavirus, as far as different flu viruses go (granted corona isn't even a flu but the previous sars outbreak had the most severe symptomts shortly after the apperance of such, with them subsiding after a couple of days), the condition is most severe shortly after symptoms appear. In 2-3 days the condition gets better despite the flu usually lingering 7+ days after that point.

My point being is that while I certainly agree that nations have reasons to downplay the virus and information from China should always be taken with a grain of salt, I don't think spreading hysteria is a solution either. People should think calmly about the information that we have. Be careful and responsible.

On Monday, the cabinet met as a matter of urgency to discuss how to curb a possible corona crisis. Various scenarios were discussed there. Afterwards, none of those present wanted to say anything, but the so-called ""worst-case scenario"" is also taken into account.

The advice of the so-called Outbreak Management Team , which has not been published, states that in addition to nursing homes, barracks must also be used to accommodate patients infected with the virus, just like nursing containers and nursing tents. The armed forces should take care of the tents as well as the barracks.

Extremely important

Also consider how many care staff from private clinics can be deployed, or involve defense

Letter Outbreak Management Team

According to the experts, it is extremely important that locations are chosen where special medical provisions can be made, such as the possibility of administering oxygen, they write.

The advice, drawn up at the end of February, also reports more about the deployment of additional healthcare staff than Minister Bruins has said so far. ""With regard to the mobilization of personnel, it is recommended to also consider how many healthcare personnel from private clinics can be deployed, or to involve defense personnel.""

According to its own website, the Defense organization is already working with 12 hospitals in the Netherlands. Military medical personnel are employed here if they are not deployed. A large number of medical specialists work for the armed forces, including specialized doctors, surgical assistants and nursing staff.

Scarce protective equipment

Another remarkable glimpse into the kitchen; the experts from the Outbreak Management Team write that attention must be paid in the media to the 'importance of proper use of scarce personal protective equipment'. 'Unnecessary use' must also be reduced.

Bruins then said in a letter to Parliament last Monday evening: ,, I would like to emphasize once again that personal protective equipment is primarily needed to treat patients in the healthcare sector and offer little protection for general use. Use of it by the public is not a practical measure, according to the RIVM. ""

The underlying advice is, oddly enough, not the same as the Letter to Parliament published via the usual websites of the Second Chamber and the Central Government. MPs - who receive documents from ministries via a separate system - also received nothing at that time, confirms SP MP Maarten Hijink when asked.

Hospitals have just been urged

The fact that Defense facilities are made available in emergency situations gives more peace than the remark about nursing homes

Minister Bruins (Medical care)

Hijink says about the advice: ,, The fact that Defense facilities are made available in emergency situations gives more peace than the remark about nursing homes. With the letter from Monday it seems that hospitals are only now being urged to look for extra care. We want to know from the minister exactly how this works. ""

Prime Minister Rutte and Minister Bruins said Tuesday afternoon after a cabinet crisis meeting that they will work out emergency scenarios for an epidemic in the coming period. It will always be about 'appropriate measures' based on the current state of affairs.

236,"&gt;At issue was whether to impose a federal quarantine order on the evacuees to prevent them from leaving for 14 days. Such authority had not been used since a smallpox outbreak in 1969. But officials had to find some way to make sure the passengers did not leave the base until it was clear they were not infected.

&gt;Mr. Azar pushed for the order but others were wary, concerned it could cause panic. They decided to ask the passengers to voluntarily stay at the military base. One woman balked, so California officials, who use quarantine authority more often, stepped in and forced the passengers to stay.

&gt;Time to Provoke China?

&gt;By the end of January, the virus was veering out of control in China, the source of 23,000 visitors to the United States each day. Any one of them could be the trigger for a new and undetected American outbreak.

&gt;Over four days in the White House Situation Room, the nation’s top public health and national security officials engaged in a fierce debate over whether to take the extraordinary step of banning travel from China.

&gt;Public health officials were initially wary. Experts have long recommended against restricting travel during outbreaks, arguing that it is often ineffective and can stymie the response by limiting the movements of doctors and other health professionals trying to contain the disease. A ban would anger China, they worried, ending any hope of cooperation with American medical teams.

&gt;Officials at the National Security Council and Department of Homeland Security argued that China had already proved unwilling to cooperate. A third group inside the White House was worried that the move would incite panic and could roil the financial markets.

&gt;By Thursday, Jan. 30, the public health officials had come around. Mr. Azar, Dr. Redfield and Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, agreed that a ban on travel from the epidemic’s center could buy some time to put into place prevention and testing measures. “There was so much we didn’t know about this virus,” Dr. Redfield said in an interview. “We were rapidly understanding it was much more transmissible, that it had a great ability to go global.”

&gt;The debate moved that afternoon to the Oval Office, where Mr. Azar and others urged the president to approve the ban. “The situation has changed radically,” Mr. Azar told Mr. Trump.

&gt;Others in the room urged being more cautious, arguing that a ban could have unforeseen consequences. “This is unprecedented,” warned Kellyanne Conway, the president’s counselor. Mr. Trump was skeptical, though he would later claim that everyone around him had been against the idea. The two countries were in delicate trade negotiations. Was this the time to provoke China? he asked. And what about the consequences on the economy?

&gt;The president sided with his more aggressive aides, and announced the ban next day.

&gt;Still, Mr. Trump was publicly upbeat about the effects of the virus. At a campaign rally in New Hampshire in early February, as the World Health Organization was announcing new cases by the tens of thousands, he said of the coronavirus, “By April, you know, in theory, when it gets a little warmer, it miraculously goes away.”

&gt;In fact, the fight against the virus was already beginning to stumble.

&gt;A system used to track travelers returning from China went offline just as state officials were told to begin monitoring them. Mr. Azar said at a congressional hearing that he needed at least 300 million respirator masks for health care workers, but the national emergency stockpile, the government’s reserve of disaster supplies, held only 12 million, and many of those had expired.

&gt;And a C.D.C. coronavirus test distributed to state labs had a flawed component that led to sometimes inconclusive results, crippling the nation’s testing capacity for weeks, despite assurances by the administration that it was quickly being resolved.

&gt;Americans stranded in Japan on a cruise ship, the Diamond Princess, were finally returned home Feb. 17, but the president became enraged when he learned that 14 of the passengers had tested positive for the virus in the process of being transferred to government planes.

&gt;He later said that he was worried that bringing back people who tested positive for the virus would increase the public tally of people infected in the United States.

&gt;The month ended with a whistle-blower’s claim that workers from the Department of Health and Human Services had been sent to greet returning Americans from China at two military bases in California without the personal protective gear that is required for anyone coming into contact with potentially exposed patients. None of the workers tested positive for the virus, but the allegation shook Congress.

&gt;‘I Like the Numbers Being Where They Are.’

&gt;The president’s motorcade pulled onto the main C.D.C. campus in Atlanta just before 4:30 p.m. on Friday, passing protesters holding signs that said “Have faith in science” and “We need a vaccine against Trump.”

&gt;Ten weeks after the virus first emerged in China, the total number of confirmed cases in the world surged past 100,000 and public health experts warned darkly that the outbreak was far from over. The United States, they said, faces weeks, if not months, of uncertainty and continued disruptions in education, businesses, commerce, medicine, government and daily life.

&gt;“Time matters,” Dr. Redfield said in an interview on Friday.

&gt;Last week, Vice President Mike Pence was given control of the public messaging, and although Mr. Pence has had some mixed messages of his own — he promised more tests before they were available — the White House has since displayed more discipline. Mr. Pence holds twice daily conference calls with officials from across the country, and a virus task force he leads issues daily talking points, with comment from the health professionals, to make sure the message is consistent.

&gt;But the president still has his bullhorn. During his visit to the C.D.C., Mr. Trump told reporters that he was not inclined to let 21 people who tested positive for the virus on a cruise ship off the coast of California onto American soil.

&gt;“They would like to have the people come off,” he said. “I would like to have the people stay.” The president said he would allow health experts to make the final decision, but he made clear again where he stood.

&gt;His concern? It would increase the tally for the number of people infected in the United States. “Because I like the numbers being where they are,” the president said.

&gt;The fact that it took weeks for global health officials to settle on what to call an illness that has already [**infected more than 64,000 people and killed more than 1,300**](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) shows just how fraught the naming process can be.    
&gt;  
&gt;“We had to find a name that did not refer to a geographical location, an animal, an individual, or a group of people, and which is also pronounceable and related to the disease,” said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the WHO, during a press conference this week.

Why not call it a Wuhan virus? Because it isn't in Wuhan anymore. It's everywhere. Tying it to a single location fuels widespread discrimination against people with the most superficial connections to that location, like having Asian features. That discrimination doesn't only impact thousands of completely innocent people. It also gets in the way of addressing the real reasons for the spread of the disease, which leads to more deaths and illnesses.

Additionally, tying the disease to a particular location gives people false hope that they aren't as susceptible to the disease as long as they avoid contact with the original infected population. AIDS was dismissed as ""gay disease"" for decades before finally getting treated as a universal health crisis. In some parts of the world, leaders continue to use the original stigma to reject the most basic measures that would bring AIDS under control.

Sure China doesn't want people associating the disease with its handling of the outbreak. But that's not going to change where the disease goes next. Trump's total failure to prepare or react in time have far more to do with its spread in the US than anything China did. Imagine if China hadn't conducted any quarantine at all instead of their massive lockdown. The rest of the world would have been hit that much harder. What does obsessing over the origin point contribute toward fighting the disease? The millions of people in Wuhan didn't all create the disease, pick their government, or live all their lives differently than the rest of humanity for the outbreak to hit them before everyone else. The disease originated near them. It didn't stay put for long.

Professionals made all these points to news organizations. The news organizations adapted to the new information and switched their terminology. No conspiracy, no clickbait motives. Whereas right-wing propaganda outlets go out of their way to pretend it's all part of a liberal campaign to whitewash China's crimes or something along those lines.

In the past, this was of little consequence since it granted only a short interval of additional life to those will ultimately succumb, and did so at enormous economic and social costs. After all, the etiologic agents responsible for the pandemics were not identified until years after the epidemic peaked, and effective vaccination or drug treatment was not even remotely possible in real-time.  In the AIDS pandemic, the etiologic agent was not identified until 3-years after the start of the pandemic, a diagnostic test was not developed until 4-years later and effective pharmacological management (HAART) was not in place until a decade later.

Times have changed with advancing technology. **COVID-19 was identified, sequenced and a diagnostic test was developed and implemented within a matter of weeks following the start of the epidemic.** This raises the possibility that effective drug(s) treatment may become available on a much faster timeline than has previously been possible. Indeed, there are a number of promising lead candidate drugs  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4136000/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4136000/)  and the SARSCoV drug remdesivir is currently in Phase III clinical trials for the treatment of COBID-19. What this means is that keeping as many people free from infection for as long as possible is a reasonable strategy in an era where automated combinatorial chemistry, drug screening and intelligent design of therapeutic molecules have become a reality. These and other developments offer the very real possibility that an effective therapeutic drug(s) may be developed and deployed in a matter of months, rather than in a matter of years.

One case was all it took for all borders to close, trapping thousands of people out of their homes and into close quarters. They literally moved 600 people into hotels and apartments made for 200. We're in closer quarters now than ever.

The supermarkets and banks are madhouses. You separate everyone for 22 hours a day, that's great, but every day hundreds of people conglomerate en masse in supermarkets less than an inch from each other's faces. Touching things and putting them down, touching people to try and pass, hanging out in the aisles talking. It's way worse than going about your day normally, where you're never forced to spend time with people crammed like sardines. Everyone buys only what they can carry home since nobody is allowed to drive or bike or use any other form of transport, which means everyone has to go to the supermarket every day or every other day.

 You're way more likely to catch corona this way, and pass it to people at home, since all grocery delivery was suspended. Again, we have zero cases, but if we did catch a case it would quickly spread everywhere, especially if it were one of the 2,000 displaced people in the city forced to stay in overbooked hotels with hundreds of other strangers.

Good times that.
We have universal health care in theory. We are understaffed. We are short on doctors, short on over 40 k nurses whose median age is 55.
Doctors are often forced to work over 400 hrs per month with a record of around 600.
I joined reddit last week bc I saw ppl freaking out how come can doctors in Wuhan just die they're doctors omg.
Like, we had cases, plural, of doctors in thirties or forties collapsing or even dying on their endless shifts. No outbreaks needed.
Abuse of medical workers is how government pretends we still have a health care system at all bc if doctors etc worked like they should WHO would be on our butts. Currently unless you are dying, visiting a specialist can take from months to a year. Same with diagnostics. Surgery if you aren't dying? Years. I was hit by a car, needed an mri before deciding if I can sign up for surgery, I had to set a go fund me for both bc the system told me to wait 9 months for an mri and then 6 years for surgery. I can't work? Tough luck I should be happy I'm not actively dying right?
But when you already can't work bc you're too disabled the system will magically cure you like Jesus even though a disability welfare is like less than 200 if measured in euro which is below the existence minimum.
For a good few years now putting hospital beds in hospital ward halls is standard now.
ERs are frequently overcrowded bc sometimes it's the only way to get any diagnostics so you can sit there and wait over 24 hrs even if you need medical attention asap. 
For years health care professionals have been going on strikes but neither governments nor the opposition (when back in power) cares.
When iirc last year lots of disabled ppl gathered on strike in front of govt hq the officials told them to go home and don't ruin the sight or even made tweets implying they should go die lol.

244,"Dont let it scare you. I honestly dont know that it's getting worse and worse as far as the situation- imo its exactly where a lot of us expected it to be only because we are a week or 2 behind because of the potentially long incubation period.  So I absolutely expected a few cases to pop up globally, aswell as h2h transmission directly around those that popped up. That's just from me absorbing the news since modding this sub so I imagine those directly working with the virus have a much better idea of what's expected even though there are so many uncertainties.

There haven't been a whole lot of pictures here on reddit other than the ones with no sources so its hard imo to relate emotionally to what's going on which is why nim I've chosen to statt.posting journalists photos fro. Their articles. Because this image is not something we see everyday it automatically is going to provoke emotion. It , imo, looks ""wrong"" with the juxtaposition of the workers vs the backdrop. It *looks* like a scifi film or something. In reality they are just spraying disinfectants - like bleaching a countertop after raw chicken or cleaning as bathroom after the stomach flu. That in itself isnt really now- granted I've never seen it done quite like this... but don't  let the fact that it looks like it could realistically be from an apocalyptic movie doesnt mean that it's getting worse. It's just pictures like this arent really floating around as much.

We saw similar substance used IN wuhan on wechat videos released right before they locked it down, and also so images of airports using similar devices on their hallways between planes and building.  I say that because it may seem like am escalation as news breaks, but imo its really just because we are becoming more aware of the situation. 

As far as the locks owns I was.hoping there wouldn't be more but until the spread is definitely contained I felt it was inevitable there would be more *somewhere*

If you feel like you're overwhelmed maybe take a break from following this or other virus subs for a while its s very emotionally draining subject. It doesnt make you less of a man to admit that if anything I think it makes you more of one personally.  No shame in that.

245,"So let's think about a couple of factors first. US population, city size, and living situations. So China's population is roughly 4 times that of the United States, 1.4 billion compared to 325 million. Wuhan is a city of 11 million, for contrast the largest city in the US, New York is only 8.6 million. What this all means is that people in China live much closer together. They take more public transportation and they share more sanitary facilities than is common in the US. Google Chinese bathrooms and understand that it is common for them to be shared. That means the virus is much easier to spread, especially before people are aware of it. If everyone is crammed into subway cars, and sharing bathrooms you are more likely to catch it than if you are commuting to work alone in your car. So with that in mind, I dont think the US or Europe will take any more extreme measure than to say wash your hands frequently, avoid touching your face, and stay home if you are sick. These are effective measures to prevent the transmission. 
But to the extreme, the federal government at ready.org lists how to prepare for a pandemic and the preparation is essentially stockpile essentials for 2 weeks. Its really hard to spread a virus if everyone is in their homes. I don't think that will happen in the US because we seem to have a responsive system in the CDC, as much as people will put them down in this sub. I do think it is likely the US will extend the travel ban on China but I think that might involve Global economics more than anyone will like to admit. Canada is still allowing Chinese citizens in and we are not seeing an epidemic there. Furthermore Trump's entire election strategy is the current stock market. Any quarantine or outbreak will hurt that number so I think every measure will take place to prevent that.
 Also in terms of transminssion, the Chicago resident who contracted the virus from his wife and then traveled to different job sites. So far there has not been reported additional cases off of that and I will guarantee that those people are all being closely monitored. The number of reported cases we are seeing now in China, especially in Hubei I believe are transmission within close family units. If a person gets it, and then gives it to their close family members that will burn itself out when there are no more members of their family to give it to. Daily percentage increase of infected is down to roughly 8% in China and seemingly dropping. And even on the the cruise ship with 61 confirmed cases that is only 2% of the total passengers. Think about that. In a close quarters situation only 2% of people got it. That seems a lot less transmittable than other sources would make it seem. I think people on this sub and on r/coronavirus are almost rooting for things to get worse, but currently it does seem like Chins has some grasp on the situation. Why because if 2% of all Chinese people get it that's still 28 million people. And with 2% mortality you're talking about half a million dead. That number they will not be able to hide, the market will tank and the CCP will lose its fragile grasp on the country. So before that can happen they will do everything in their power to prevent mass infection. Oh and I get ""their censorship spread the virus"" but what would spread a virus faster than yelling ""plague"" and having infected people run away to all corners of the country. Well there is my rant, it's an optimistic look but I have taken the steps the federal government recommends in preparation in case of a pandemic. And although I dont like Trump I do believe that he worships the almighty S&amp;P 500 and will do anything to protect that, which means taking appropriate steps to limit a pandemic.",1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0
246,"Yes I'm struggling to build up a personal policy over this.

I think taking into account the individual you're talking with is paramount.

Some will be in a state of denial due to sheer ignorance and laziness... whilst on the other end of the spectrum will be those who are in a state of denial because they cannot psychologically cope with conceiving the situation.

For those of my friends who wilfully respond with a degree of complacency &amp; dismissal : I use an approach of dropping as much honesty as I can... avoiding sugar coating the information. 

For those who i suspect are using in a state or avoidance due to their underlying anxiety I take a more nuanced approach.... focussing more on a spiritual outlook to give them some grounding to cope with what will eventually become reality.

Some people will fall in between these categories so it's really about meeting the individual you are dealing with in a manner appropriate to where they are, being respectful of that, and being as honest as possible.

Ultimately the golden rule applies : treat others as you would wish to be treated.

Staying calm, collected and careful with what you say and how you say it will be the most powerful indicator to success.

I've certainly seen a number of people I know change positions now from dismissive to actively concerned.

Some, however will not understand until the grim consequences of this thing are at their door. 

As an aside.....

I am personally what would be termed a 911 Truther. I seriously question the official narrative of 911 and am quite convinced there is another story to it which can be deduced and understood with availIable information.

Despite this what it has taught me is that theres no point arguing with a mob whove got their fingers in their ears. I've seen it with Brexit and the Iraq war too.

I have learned to accept many people will die not knowing what I know about these subjects. I have relieved myself of the responsibility of educating others on such matters.

I recognise much of what I see in the COVID19 community as echoing the same kind of problems that traditional conspiracy crowds have faced in my time.

A helpful parable from the bible ( I'm not Christian, personally) is about planting your seeds in fertile ground... rather than scattering seed on dry rock and expecting it to grow.

To take this metaphor a little further : once you've planted your seed, it will be silly to stand over it waiting for it to grow. You might stamp your feet and get angry at how slow it is, but you might be blocking out the light it needs:

People need time to process.

Plant your seed as skillfully as you can, and walk away to plant elsewhere- let nature take its course.

Also.... ( another good one from the bible) - is dont cast your Pearl's before swine:

You've only got so much energy and so much time. Save what focused energy you have for those who are engaged and ready to listen.... do not waste your energy on those who are belligerent as you are depriving that energy from those of richer soil who would most benefit from it.

247,"Allergy symptoms can be debilitating: itchy, red, watery eyes; sneezing; runny nose and sometimes, coughing. This year, the coronavirus adds a layer of unease to the seasonal annoyance, especially in areas such as Washington, D.C., where pollen counts are already at moderate to high levels. With fear rising in tandem with the number of cases of covid-19, the respiratory disease caused by the virus, doctors worry allergy sufferers will conflate their routine reactions to pollen with coronavirus symptoms and overwhelm an already-strained health care system with panicked visits.

“It can be confusing, and it’s important to differentiate. If it’s viral, every time you cough, you’re spreading droplets within a six-feet radius” that can infect others, said Sally Joo Bailey, an allergist at Allergy Associates of Northern Virginia in Arlington and the past president of the Greater Washington Asthma, Allergy and Clinical Immunology Society. Allergies, on the other hand, are not contagious.

Because of warmer temperatures, allergy season started in February this year instead of March, Bailey said, so Washington-area residents are already exhibiting symptoms. Data show that some people infected with the coronavirus experience similar symptoms, such as coughing, nasal congestion, runny nose and sore throat.
AD

But there are key differences between the virus and allergies that should help allay unnecessary panic. Allergies, which are an overreaction of the immune system to foreign particles, should not trigger chills, body aches or fevers, Bailey said. Those are the classic signs of a viral infection, such as covid-19. In addition, while patients with coronavirus can have nasal congestion, it is not common. The World Health Organization found that only about 5 percent of the coronavirus patients in China had nasal congestion. About 14 percent had a sore throat.

Governmental agencies debunk bogus coronavirus cures such as bleach, garlic and silver

 Unfortunately, we are still in cold and flu season, which can go on until as late as May, and it is less easy to differentiate between covid-19 and those illnesses. Both cold and the flu, or influenza, are, like covid-19, viral infections transmitted through person-to-person contact. Flu is accompanied by fever, and a cold can cause fever, too. Both the flu and the coronavirus can cause a dry cough. A cold can be accompanied by a wet or dry cough.

The flu vaccine provides no protection against the coronavirus and does not guarantee you will not get the flu, so people who have been vaccinated against flu but are experiencing flu-like symptoms should take them seriously.
AD

“In Virginia and Maryland, flu activity is still high,” said Jesse L. Goodman, an infectious disease specialist at Georgetown University. “Even an experienced clinician can’t always tell the difference between viral infections without testing.”

When in doubt, it is best to consult a doctor, Goodman said. “They’ll probably ask about general health and medications to assess your risk group.” Patients with high fever and difficulty breathing will be asked to come in but as cases of covid-19 rise, patients exhibiting mild symptoms may be asked to stay home rather than come in for testing since there is no medication for the disease, only supportive care. “We have a desire to test for flu because we have a treatment that helps with that,” Goodman said, referring to the antiviral medication used to treat some flu patients.

Here are some suggestions from experts about how to handle this confluence of seasonal allergies, the common cold, influenza and the coronavirus.
AD

Sign up for our Coronavirus Updates newsletter to track the outbreak. All stories linked within the newsletter are free to access.

● Experienced seasonal allergy sufferers should pay close attention to allergy symptoms they are familiar with and treat them as they normally would. That includes showering and washing your hair as soon as you get home to remove pollen and taking the antihistamine that works best for you. Some antihistamines, such as Benadryl, have sedative effects and work quickly but must be retaken every four to six hours. Others such as Allegra, Claritin and Zyrtec are long-lasting and non-sedating but can require up to several hours to take effect. Antihistamines should provide some relief. If they do not, consult a primary care physician or an allergist.

● Anyone not feeling well should watch for a fever. Coronavirus can cause high fever, severe cough and shortness of breath. If you have a fever accompanied by difficulty breathing, seek medical help immediately.

● While is important that healthcare professionals have the space and resources to help those who really need it, feel free to call your doctor’s office with concerns. A nurse can ask questions that will help determine whether you need to be examined immediately. “We don’t want to flood the system, especially the emergency rooms right now,” said Elizabeth Douglass, an infectious diseases specialist at Dell Seton Medical School at the University of Texas at Austin.
AD

● Get a flu shot, if you have not. Flu activity in Maryland and Virginia has been decreasing for the third week in a row but it is still high. The CDC reports that this season’s flu vaccine decreases chances of catching the flu by 45 percent. People who have not gotten the flu vaccine still can and should.

● Find out whether you are a candidate for the pneumonia vaccine. Both the flu and coronavirus can result in pneumonia, which can be life-threatening. Adults over the age of 65 or others with certain chronic medical conditions may benefit from the vaccine, which provides protection from the most common pneumonia in adults.

● Wash your hands. This helps prevent the spread of all viral infections, including cold, influenza and the coronavirus. Use soap and warm water, and scrub well.

Don’t just wash your hands to prevent coronavirus. Moisturize them, too.

● Don’t panic. There is no need to purchase face masks or wear them unless you have a contagious viral infection or you are caring for someone who is.

 “No one can say right now that this is not significant virus,” Goodman said of the coronavirus. “But I think it is really important that people realize this is not Ebola,” which has an average case fatality rate of 50 percent, compared with the World Health Organization’s current estimate of between 3 and 4 percent for COVID-19. “It does appear that the great majority of people have a mild illness and get better.”

He emphasized that as we enter allergy season and exit cold and flu season, it is important that the public does not rush to the emergency room with seasonal allergies and minor illnesses, or purchase masks and hand sanitizer unnecessarily.

“Sometimes fear can be more dangerous than a virus,” he said. “People may put themselves and other people in danger.”",0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0
248,"I am living in Germany, a country that has ""free healthcare"" - i.e. it's paid for by taxes off your paycheck. There are pros and cons to public health insurance:

Pro:

- I can go to a checkup without paying anything, which makes it easier to recognize diseases early on
- Employer pays one half of my insurance, I pay the other half. I think that's fair.
- I don't have to worry about hospital bills, every day in the hospital only costs 10€.
- I know of some people that are on private that got teeth removed even though they didn't need to be removed - because the doctor was earning more money per tooth, so doctors prescribe more medicine than necessary. Which usually doesn't happen in a public system since there's no motivation to prescribe more medicine than necessary.
- With private health insurance, you usually get parts of your money back if you don't use up your insurance on a per-year basis. With public health insurance, you're paying even if you haven't been sick in years and you don't get anything back.

Cons:

- Higher taxes, obviously. Nothing is ""free"". I have to pay about 300€ monthly off my paycheck for insurance, but remember: the more income you have, the more you pay. That's 3600€ per year. Private insurance is about 500€ / month, depending on your income it may actually be cheaper than public insurance. I know of people who switched to private because they were paying 900€ in taxes per month.
- System gets abused by work-shy and lazy people, i.e. ""yeah let me just get a attestation on Monday, I don't want to work today"". Generally the work ethic in Germany is higher than in America, i.e. people who abuse the system get looked down upon, so not that many people do it.
- You have to wait months / years for basic treatments, even emergencies don't get treated immediately. I got rolled into the hospital with a near-failing kidney, doctor just said ""well it's not bleeding yet, so you can wait another month, we're currently booked out"".
- Higher bureaucracy and lower quality healthcare. Everything has to be checked ""is this covered by public insurance"" (if not, ""get fucked"") - and if you get a treatment it's guaranteed to be the lowest quality possible (so the state can save its money).
- Since our govt decided to use those taxes to repay national debt rather than , the healthcare system got stripped to its absolute core. Hospitals in rural areas closed and got centralized into big cities. Now the central hospitals - who are already strapped for cash - are working around the clock to get the waiting lists managed somehow. Need an X-Ray? 2 Months. Need braces? 1 Year. A colleague of mine has private insurance, he got his braces within weeks (but had to pay more, obviously).
- Many treatments are not covered by public insurance - their attorneys do everything they can in order to still make you pay for your medicine *on top of already high taxes*. I.e. you get fucked in the ass twice.

It's ""free"" healthcare as long as you're not using it. Once shit actually hits the fan, you'll start to see the cracks in ""free"" healthcare system. I'm not saying full private healthcare is better, but ELIMININATING private insurance is ABSOLUTELY NOT the way to go. It's okay to have a safety net for poor people, but that can be easily turned  into a hammock for lazy people. In Germany we have two systems: private and public. If you have an income above 63k / year, you can opt-out of public insurance. I do think you can have public healthcare without ruining an economy (see NHS in Britain), but not by forbidding private insurance. I do think our system is okay, but it needs a government that actually wants to benefit the people - and my personal opinion of politicians is that no matter how much they say they work ""for the people"", in the end they always try to benefit themselves. Our health minister is an absolute joke, he tried to combat the coronavirus by making people fill out forms instead of producing testing kits. The insane bureaucracy of a centralized health care system is something often forgotten - people laugh about Mike ""just pray it away"" Pence, but in the end it's the same shitshow over here, even with ""affordable"" healthcare.

TLDR: It can work, but there are cons to consider.

Also, the ""free college"" is retarded. We implemented ""free college"" over here and the end result is that now *everyone* goes to college, even people who shouldn't. And after implementing a ""nobody gets left behind"" policy even your grades don't even matter anymore. This in turn reduced the actual value of a degree - now that everyone has a degree and schools are overcrowded with struggling students, the quality of education has declined and all that has changed is how many years you have to waste in school. The same things that got taught in school in 10 years now take 15 years - we have doctors and lawyers out the ass but we're lacking mechanics, roof tilers and craftsmen.",1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0
249,"**With this new coronavirus outbreak, working from home is no longer a privilege, it’s a necessity.**

The sanitary risk of a 2019-nCoV outbreak in New York City is an opportunity for most companies to test working from home at scale.

Apart from contributing to a healthier environment, helping employers and employees save money on transportation and office space, and promoting equal opportunities in the employment market, working from home might be the most efficient containment measure each individual could take part of.

Of course, working from home is not ideal, it's a skill, it takes time to acquire, both for employees and employers. It’s going to mean a lot of video chats and phone calls, but many tools are already available for a reasonable price: Slack, Zoom, Yammer, Dropbox, Google Drive.... and or course VPN tools to improve cybersecurity. 

Yes, some jobs are not really adapted. Retail industry for example, but most importantly some critical services like power generation, grid services, communications, and food production. However, those services only require a small percentage of the population to maintain in the modern days.

Focusing first on tech companies, advertising firms, and financial institutions would make sense. A growing number of US companies are already working as fully distributed teams. More [recently](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-business/firms-in-china-extend-holidays-ask-staff-to-work-from-home-as-virus-spreads-idUSKBN1ZQ0BO), some Chinese corporate giants including Alibaba Group and Tencent have asked staff to work from home for one week after an extended Lunar New Year break ends, seeking to limit the spread of the 2019-nCoV virus.

A 2015 study from [Stanford University](https://nbloom.people.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj4746/f/wfh.pdf) in California found that productivity among employees at a Chinese travel agency went up by 13% when they worked from home due to fewer breaks and more comfortable work environments.

Working from home seems to result in higher productivity, help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution, commute congestion, and most importantly would be an efficient measure to contain a possible rapid outbreak of the 2019-nCoV virus in densely populated cities such as New York City.

251,"WUHAN, China — Weak with fever, An Jianhua waited in line for seven hours outside the hospital in the cold, hoping to get tested for the new coronavirus, which doctors suspected she had contracted.

Ms. An, 67, needed an official diagnosis from a hospital to qualify for treatment, but the one she and her son raced to last week had no space, even to test her. The next hospital they were referred to here in Wuhan, the  city of 11 million people at the center of the outbreak, was full, too, they said. They finally got an intravenous drip for Ms. An’s fever, but that was all.

Since then, Ms. An has quarantined herself at home. She and her son eat separately, wear masks at home and are constantly disinfecting their apartment. Ms. An’s health is declining rapidly, and even keeping water down is a struggle.

“I can’t let my mom die at home,” said her son, He Jun. “Every day I want to cry, but when I cry there are no tears. There is no hope.”

As countries race to deal with an outbreak that has begun spreading around the world, inciting panic and disrupting the global economy, the residents of Wuhan are waging a daily battle to survive an illness that has sickened more than 4,100 people and killed 224 in their city alone.

Last month, the government put Wuhan in a virtual lockdown, sealing off the city and banning most public transportation and private cars from its streets in a desperate effort to contain the outbreak. Now, many residents say it is nearly impossible to get the health care they need to treat — or even diagnose — the coronavirus.

Expressing exasperation, doctors say there is a shortage of testing kits and other medical supplies, and it is not clear why more are not available. The ban on transportation means some residents have to walk for hours to get to hospitals — if they are well enough to make the journey. Layers of bureaucracy stand between residents and help. And the long lines outside hospitals for testing and treatment suggest that the outbreak is spreading far beyond the official count of cases.

Ambulances, too, are hard to come by, residents say. In recent days, some say they have called 120, China’s equivalent of the emergency number 911, only to be told that there were already hundreds of people in the queue.

Those who do make it to the hospital say they are squeezed together for hours in waiting rooms, where infections are easily spread. But the shortages have meant that many are ultimately turned away and sent home to self-quarantine, potentially compounding the outbreak by exposing their families.

Many doctors and residents are putting their hopes on the two new coronavirus hospitals that China has been racing to build in Wuhan in just a matter of days. One of them spans about eight acres, has 1,000 beds and is scheduled to open on Monday. The government says 1,400 military medical workers will be deployed to work there, potentially helping with the shortage of health professionals on hand to combat the outbreak.

On Sunday, city officials announced plans to set up quarantine stations around Wuhan for people with symptoms of pneumonia and close contacts among coronavirus patients. But just over a week into the lockdown, many residents believe the virus has already spread much further than the official numbers suggest.

“The situation that we’ve seen is much worse than what has been officially reported,” Long Jian, 32, said outside a hospital where his elderly father was being treated. Mr. Long said his father had to go to six hospitals and wait seven days before he could even be tested for the coronavirus.

Just steps from where Mr. Long spoke, beds could be seen lining both sides of a narrow corridor in the emergency room. One man was getting an intravenous drip outside in his car.

“Those who can get diagnosed and treated are the lucky ones,” Mr. Long said. “In our neighborhood, many who weren’t able to get diagnosed ended up dying at home.”

Getting treatment for the coronavirus in a hospital requires jumping through a number of hoops.

According to official guidelines, patients are encouraged to go to their local hospitals first for initial assessments and sometimes prescriptions. Then patients are to deliver the results to their local neighborhood committees, which are responsible for communicating with the hospitals and coordinating resources for the households in their areas. There are about 1,000 neighborhood committees in Wuhan, for a population of 11 million.

Patients with mild symptoms are typically told to go home and self-quarantine, according to a Jan. 24 notice by city officials. Those who have more severe symptoms are flagged by the neighborhood committees, which arrange for transportation by ambulance to one of the two dozen or so hospitals designated for treating the coronavirus.

But in practice, patients and their relatives say that the process takes far too long, and that the bar for what constitutes “severe symptoms” has been set too high — so they give up and try waiting in long lines at hospitals instead.

Amy Hu said her 64-year-old mother went to the doctor after experiencing a fever, cough, shortness of breath and diarrhea about 10 days ago. Based on the initial assessment, the doctor told Ms. Hu’s mother that she had contracted the coronavirus. But the test needed to confirm the diagnosis was not available, the doctor said.

Without the test, her mother couldn’t be admitted to a hospital. Since then, Ms. Hu said, they have been waiting at home to hear back from the hospital about when her mother can be tested. In recent days Ms. Hu, who has been visiting her parents for the Lunar New Year holiday, took precautions herself: She checked into a hostel with her two children.

“I’m very dissatisfied with the government,” Ms. Hu said. “It’s like only when the patients are close to death can they be admitted to a hospital.”

Tong Yixuan, 31, said Sunday that he panicked last week when he learned that in just a few days, his father’s cold had escalated into a full-blown illness that doctors said was almost certainly the coronavirus.

But neither his father, who had a 104-degree fever and was slipping in and out of consciousness, nor his mother, who was starting to show similar symptoms, could get tested. Hospitals said that there was no space, and that their symptoms were not severe enough, Mr. Tong said. His parents were sent home to quarantine themselves.

There was no way for Mr. Tong to help. He was more than 60 miles away in Huangshi, which days ago had been locked down by the government along with many other cities in Hubei Province. The roads out of Huangshi and into Wuhan had all been sealed off. For days, Mr. Tong was stuck. Only Saturday, after hours of negotiation with local officials, was he able to make it to his parents’ bedside, he said. They have since been tested for the coronavirus, and his father has been admitted to a hospital. The process took 10 days.

“All I want to do is take care of my parents,” Mr. Tong said. “I don’t even care if I get infected.”

For some people, like Gan Hanjiang, the new hospitals cannot be built fast enough.

Last month, his father came down with a severe fever and cough. He was tested for the coronavirus, but the results were negative. Ten days after the onset of symptoms, however, his father died, Mr. Gan said.

The hospital classified the cause as “severe pneumonia,” Mr. Gan said, but he believes it was the coronavirus. Several experts have recently conceded that several rounds of testing may be needed for an accurate diagnosis of the virus.

On the day his father died, Mr. Gan began to show the same symptoms, he said. But without a car, he has not been able to go to one of the designated hospitals to get tested for the coronavirus.

“Getting treatment is so difficult,” he whispered slowly by telephone from a small hospital near his home where he was being treated for viral pneumonia. “We can’t get admitted to the hospitals. And there’s not enough medicine.”

252,"&gt;The scripting of it was the choreographed nature of the communist Chinese the EU mainstream controlled media. In the west the UN that let us know that this virus was going to be used to bring down western economies. Communist China bought the weaponized virus from Obama 5 years ago its been confirmed its man made there’s been an almost complete lockdown on that info even though members of the senate intelligence committee have said said that’s where all the evidence points so a manufactured virus that they know is going to create devastation and panic. It is released right as the United States won the trade war with communist China. now remember communist China is not just China it’s all the globalist interest that have built up China to be the model of authoritarianism for the entire world.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;If trump didn’t upfront understand that he was being set up and if trump didn’t try to down play it to not create panic they would then have double backed later in the corporate media and say that he had dropped the ball by not installing enough of emergency early and that it was his fault that the virus spread uncontrollably inside the United States. Even though the facts don’t show any of that, they show the opposite China said it was no big deal and was covering it up trump went along with that as to not create a new trade war then as soon as China was seen as the wonder-is good guy in all of this by all the media and saints killing people at check points and shutting down whole cities and welding people into their homes as soon as that was completed suddenly it shifted to trump hadn’t done enough, even though it was the United Nations that’s said weeks ago that trump was wrong for stopping flights from China.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;They wanted it to come here to spread and they wanted to use it as an economic crisis to kill the trump recovery and hopefully remove him from office and to stop his nation wide rallies because the virus and now the controlled corporate press is blaming trump for the virus that originated in China. so make no mistake America is at war with an axis of evil the communist Chinese is its main base of operations but the mega banks the EU the UN and the leftist across the world are banded together openly celebrating that this will kill the US recovery and America becoming great again because the last 50 years has been about slowly deindustrializing us turning us against our friends and family turning men and women against each, other race war all of this garbage and because America is coming back the globalist are so angry and so now they’re using the global power they had over the economy to try and shut our economy down and they’re so arrogant that they’re bragging about it just like Bill Mar did a week ago saying “we’re gonna bring trump down with this corona virus”.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;These people are sick and evil we have to come together and realize what’s happening and rally behind president trump and rally behind America and expose where the virus came from and the fact that it’s man made

253,"In a dingy corner of the internet is a message board, soaked in profanity, bro-speak, and greed, where posters with handles such as OverthrowYourMasters and yolo_tron campaign for their favorite stocks, putting up screenshots from their online brokerage accounts of their moonshot victories—or showing off their massive losses like badges of honor. Some of them think they’ve found the key to fast wins on the stock market. Wall Street doubts they’re right, but it’s getting nervous about what it sees there.


History hasn’t been kind to people claiming to have a magic hand. The latest sell-off, driven by a new wave of coronavirus fears, shows how quickly markets can turn on you. But even veteran traders have trouble dismissing a 900,000-user Reddit forum called r/wallstreetbets, or r/WSB for short, whose tips and tactics have shown an uncanny ability to push prices, at least for the short term. Hitherto sleepy companies such as Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc. and Plug Power Inc. went crazy shortly after being mentioned there. The board may have added a little froth to Tesla Inc.’s $90 billion rally.


The do-it-yourself traders of r/WSB are waging a kind of guerrilla warfare in the markets, trying to exploit what they see as weaknesses in the system to move prices where they want them. For anyone who wondered about where the small day traders who made the 1990s so wild went, meet the 2020 version. After years of indifference, individual investors seem to be finding their wayback to stocks, for better or worse. They’re flexing muscles in ways that can easily call to mind excesses from the dot-com era.


“There is no denying the fact that in the month of February 2020, the public is back,” says Julian Emanuel, chief equity and derivatives strategist at BTIG LLC. He thinks the S&amp;P 500 can jump an extra 10% because of small-investor enthusiasm. “This bull market is not going to end until the public falls in love with stocks, and that process may just be beginning.” Of course, timing the moment when irrational exuberance gives way to a mass exit isn’t so easy. Chatrooms where stocks were hyped are seminal artifacts of the 1990s boom and the following bust. They were a setting for bare-fisted digital brawls among all manner of hustlers and promoters, many of whom could move shares on a dime—sometimes just enough so they could get out and leave others holding the bag.


Twenty years later, one thing that’s changed is the nomenclature. It’s frequently both juvenile and objectionable. For Reddit’s band of self-styled “autists”—a term of endearment, relatively speaking, that crudely leans into stereotypes surrounding extremely online people—the chief prize is “tendies” (chicken tenders, the treat an overgrown man-child receives for being a “Good Boy”). Figuratively speaking, tendies are the financial rewards that follow from a successful bold wager. Bears are usually referred to in homophobic terms.


What this moment shares with 1999 is a rising belief that someone else will come along to buy a surging stock at an even higher price, regardless of fundamentals. But while traders at the end of the millennium were willing to wait around for a “greater fool” to show up, this generation believes it can conjure up those buyers through its own trading sleight of hand.

Members of r/WSB believe they’ve discovered a kind of perpetual motion machine in the interplay of stocks withoptions contracts, which offer a cheap way to bet on whether shares will rise or fall without buying the stock itself. It goes like this: Members make bets that rely on market makers, the professional middlemen who sell you a “call” (a bet on shares rising) or a “put” (a wager on a decline). Market makers, like good bookies, don’t want to go out on a limb. When taking a bet, they lay off the risk. If someone buys a call, for instance, speculating on a rally, the dealer buys stock in the underlying company. If the stock rises, the dealer may have to pay out on the option—but that’s offset by the gain on the shares.


When shares keep rising, managing the hedge entails buying more stock. That’s where the Reddit set perceives a weakness. A favorite tactic on r/WSB is to swamp the market with call purchases early in the morning in an attempt to force dealers to keep buying stock. Up and up everything goes—supposedly. As the stock price rises, so does the value of the calls, often by far more.
In this worldview, the only constraint on success is the force of one’s own conviction and willingness to act upon it. An added attraction: It’s all relatively cheap in terms of an option’s simple dollar cost. For the price of one share of Amazon.com Inc.—about $1,965 on Feb. 25—a decent-size campaign can be waged in long-shot options trading for pennies. That matters nowadays, when the rise of exchange-traded funds and mutual funds has convinced U.S. companies that they no longer need to split their stocks to keep the share price manageable for retail investors. Many companies now trade for three or four figures a share.


To be clear, there’s no magic money machine in options. The middlemen of the market are hardly the only players buying and selling stocks. If the rest of the market sees a reason to sell a company, it won’t matter that r/WSB is pushing it. While options can produce eye-popping gains, they frequently expire worthless.


But suddenly bullish individual investors are putting their mark on the options market. How influential have they become? Typically puts are in higher demand than calls because traders are more interested in hedging against losses. That’s often not the case now—with some stocks, demand for the bullish calls is higher. “This is not normal,” said Amy Wu Silverman, an equity derivatives strategist at RBC Capital Markets, on Bloomberg TV recently.


Benn Eifert, chief investment officer at QVR Advisors, was initially skeptical that the money behind these online message boards could sway anything. He changed his mind. “At least from the dealers”—the middlemen—“they’ll tell you in big tech names, flows are substantial, and it’s moving things,” he says. Smaller stocks are even more sensitive to sudden bursts of attention.


BTIG’s Emanuel says it’s hard to say whether today’s chatrooms or those in the late 1990s have bigger sway. “When I was sitting in a proprietary trading room in 1999, you would see certain stocks be mentioned on message boards, and the process would then be one person saying to another, ‘Hey, this looks interesting,’ ” he says. “Now you see something on a message board, and you might not necessarily see a continued discussion.” Instead, computerized traders automatically jump in. “As a human you never actually see the flow because it’s going electronically,” Emanuel says. In other words, don’t just wag a finger at message boards—look at the supposedly sophisticated algorithmic traders that are following them.


Members are aware that questionable thinking underpins their bets, to the point of self-deprecation. After user SolTrainRnsOnHolGran wondered whether r/WSB’s activities might constitute insider trading, a user named recentlyunearthed replied, “How can we have insider knowledge when we don’t have any knowledge?”


The forum’s zest for call options is a key force behind a broad market trend. By one measure, the value of options traded rose 77% over the first six weeks of 2020. Much of this expansion was concentrated in a handful of stocks popular among individual investors, says John Marshall, head of derivatives research at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. “The size of the increase in options volumes is definitely moving the needle,” he says.


The average number of contracts purchased in a single-stock option trade shrunk to just 6.7 contracts in 2020, roughly half what it was in 2015, says Henry Schwartz, president of Trade Alert LLC. Looking at the combination of small orders and heavy trading volume, he concludes, “Really, retail is the only audience.”


As the swashbuckling day trader’s imprint on the market becomes more pronounced, moderators are getting stricter in their policing of the board—or “sub,” for subreddit. One user, who’d been a member for three years without posting, laid out the bull case for Lumber Liquidators Inc. and promised another pick the following morning. Call volumes in the company jumped to 71 times the previous one-month average, with shares rising 18.6%. This user was promptly banned from r/WSB upon providing the next tip, with a moderator claiming that the poster “tried to use the platform for personal gain.” Members were warned that any interactions with the user on Reddit or discussion of the user’s latest recommendation would also get them kicked out. “This sub is a travesty,” wrote user Deftech1, complaining about the influx of those looking for—or pushing—get-rich-quick schemes. “Can we just go back to losing inordinate amounts of money?”",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0

255,"I'll try to sum it up a little, but you really should *make* the time to do your own research.

Bill Gates has long been an advocate for eugenics, or reducing the world population to ""save the earth"". The Bill and Linda Gates foundation has funded countless research on pandemics, such as the Agenda 21 meeting that took place in Oct 2019 simulating a worldwide pandemic from coronavirus.

Gates Foundation has also funded ID2020, an effort to assign ""digital certificates"" to everyone worldwide in order to verify that they have received, and continue to receive ongoing vaccinations for COVID-19. These ""digital certificates"" were developed in conjunction with MIT, and come in the form of a nanotech tattoo, or a chip placed under the skin.

It's said that the rollout of the 5G network globally is to accommodate the bandwidth needed for a global surveillance system of this magnitude. It's also been shown that the 60Hz frequency that the 5G network operates on also causes interference with the human body, specifically that it reduces water content in the lungs (respiratory distress).

As far as the Tom Hanks thing, I'll copy and paste from a previous comment I made explaining it to someone else:

&gt;The rumors are that Tom Hanks is a pedophile who possibly raped Corey Feldman, has been to Epstein's private child sex island via the ""Lolita Express"", and may be involved in some high-level child sex slave ring. Crazy shit has been said (here in this sub and elsewhere) that he raped and murdered a little girl years ago, and may have been in cahoots with Stephen Speilberg, who has been accused of passing around the little girl from Poltergeist, Heather O'Rourke, as a sex toy, leading to her death from septic shock, possibly from anal abuse, and regularly molesting kids that he's put in his films over the years.

&gt;It's also said that he faked having COVID-19 because he has been arrested in a huge global sting of elite pedophiles and child sex slave operators, including Oprah Winfrey, but it has yet to be announced to the public because the sting is still underway. Word is that this info was possibly either gleaned from Harvey Weinstein naming names as part of a plea bargain for a reduced sentence, or because Jeffery Epstein isn't dead, is actually Mossad asset created to get dirt on elite pedos around the world so they can be controlled like puppets, and is currently hiding in Israel leaking these names with his partner Giselle Maxwell as part of a huge Zionist conspiracy to control the world.

&gt;The Weinstein theory is popular with Q Anon followers, who believe it's part of Trump's master plan to take down all these evi, devil-worshipping, adrenochrome-addicted, child sex-slave raping pedophiles who exist at the highest levels of government and entertainment, and who secretly run the world.

You need to understand that as far as ""truth"" is concerned, we may never truly know. There is so much disinfo being forced into everyone's minds, it's logical to question everything. Bottom line: I would recommend not simply accepting any one narrative as the absolute truth.",0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0
256,"&gt; The base reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 (that is, the average number of people that an infected person is expected to infect, assuming no preventative measures) is normally estimated to be somewhere between 1.4 and 5.

Hmm. I got my number from [this article](https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-act-today-or-people-will-die-f4d3d9cd99ca), but now I'm not sure where in it (it's a long article) he arrives at the number, but towards the end of the article he writes:

&gt; All these measures will slow down the virus. They will lower the transmission rate from 2.5 to 2.2, maybe 2.

I suppose I may have misunderstood what the transmission rate means, as it is a drop from 250% growth to 150% growth, and my quick maths on increase in confirmed infections over a 12 day period in Denmark matches that fairly well. That comes out to 1.51; there were 6 cases on March 3rd and today (March 15) the number is 864 (end of day number); that's a 144 fold increase in 12 days; 144^(1/2) is 1.51

Let's go for 1.5 instead and do the same progression. I'm curious. I've added a column to show confirmed cases, if it takes exactly 12 days from infection to first symptom and confirmed case, and let it run until it went past 8 billion. Again, with the faulty assumption of perfect transmission paths, which never happens.

Quite a bit less of a doomsday prediction, but it's still worrisome. Denmark has 864 confirmed cases. Assuming that's all of them, then there's likely between 71,000 and 108,000 actual cases in the country. Again, it's a faulty assumption that this is a perfect lookup-table, but it is something to keep in mind, because we might think ""*well, the likelihood of me meeting one of those 864 or someone who has is low*"", but once you up that to between 1 and 2% of the entire population, that's a lot more likely. New York currently has 729 confirmed cases according to the Johns Hopkins tracker, which (if this table is 100% accurate, which it won't be) is around day 28 of the infection, which suggests somewhere between 40,000 and 70,000 infected people. I shudder to think of the consequences of it getting into a massively packed metropolis like New York City, and with that many infected it's more or less guaranteed to.

258,"I think it's a common trait among people who value economics to be astonishingly good at pretending tomorrow doesn't exist when they think it serves them. I mean economics only works at all because enough people believe the same collections of lies. Denial is one of our main tools of dishonesty.

We all feel compelled to make our understanding of the world make sense, and when we try to do this by incorporating so many false premises, lies and outright fictions, we tend to lock our selves into the false beliefs we select, due to the uncomfortable uncertainty of having to re-evaluate our positions. We cause these uncomfortable feelings in our selves because we refuse to accept our selves, our nature, our place in the Universe, and all of that which we cannot control. Finally, we compound our dishonesty by valuing our feelings over what is real. Feelings are real, but they are only our perception of the endogenous drugs we dole out to our selves.

An additional concern with the coronavirus pandemic is that while it may exact a similar toll to well known diseases like influenza, it's an additional stress on our already extremely stressed societies. We don't know what kind of event will be the proverbial straw breaking the camel's back, resulting in what we'd call collapse events, but among the possible causes this certainly rates consideration. It goes way beyond the stock market, although these fears influence that, too, because economics in practice is heavily based upon the fears, real and imagined, of the people on any given day.

&gt; Many (if not most) Chinese apartment buildings do not use [the U-bend in sewer drains](https://www.drainworks.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/1643_R.gif) (i.e. from sinks, showers, and toilets connecting to the sewer line). This is used in most developed countries because it creates a barrier stopping sewer gasses from coming up out of the drain pipes. It's very common for infectious diseases to be spread by this means in China, and there's already cases of covid-19 spreading to all residents in quarantined apartments.

260,"Matt Hancock wanted to retain membership of the EWRS as part of the EU-UK future relationship deal, however No 10 said no 

&gt;--



DOWNING Street and the Department of Health are locked in a row over post-Brexit access to an EU pandemic warning system in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak.

Matt Hancock’s department wanted to retain membership of the Early Warning and Response System (EWRS) as part of the [EU-UK future](https://old.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/fblk4x/boris_johnson_rejects_eu_demands_to_bind_uk_to/fj502ta/) relationship deal, but No 10 said “no”, The Daily Telegraph has learnt.

Senior health advisers warned that exiting the EWRS, which has helped coordinate the response to the virus and played a vital role during the bird flu outbreak, would put public health at risk.

However, the British negotiating team, which reports to Boris Johnson, did not want to blur the UK’s request for a basic, Canada-style trade deal, it is claimed. Every add-on requested by the UK would risk giving the EU leverage to demand post-Brexit alignment.

Mr Hancock is also understood to have been told he could not travel to Europe to meet other health ministers because Britain has [now left the EU](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/02/27/uks-red-lines-brexit-deal/).

The details emerged as the Department of Health disclosed 12 new cases of coronavirus in the UK, a 50 per cent increase in the space of just 24 hours.

A senior source told The Telegraph: “The Department of Health pitched for continued access to the EWRS to be an objective of the negotiations, but it was blocked because they didn’t want to be accused of seeking more than the basic Canada deal.”

David Frost, the UK’s chief negotiator who will today lead a team of more than 100 negotiators for the first round of talks in Brussels, is understood to have personally endorsed the decision not to seek EWRS access.

The decision not to seek ongoing access to the early warning system that played a vital role in previous disease outbreaks such as SARS, bird flu and Ebola, raises serious questions about the UK’s ability to protect public health, experts have warned.



The web-based system, which was set up in 1988, links the European Commission, governments and key agencies, such as the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), in order to control serious cross-border threats to health. Last month the NHS Confederation, the body that speaks for the entire health service, explicitly warned that the risk from a pandemic “could be heightened without continued cooperation with EU” on health issues.

Niall Dickson, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation and its Brexit Health Alliance, which includes research and patient bodies, warned on Feb 7 that “public health is at risk in a number of areas if health is not made a priority in the forthcoming negotiations with the EU”.

In a five-page briefing paper, the Alliance set out five priorities for negotiators including “participation in key EU data-sharing platforms and alert systems, such as the Early Warning and Response System”.

Sources said the Government, which has been at pains in recent times to say it does not want “[special access](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/02/28/boris-johnson-news-latest-brexit-trade-deal-heathrow/)” to the EU, had ignored that request.

Separately, The Telegraph understands that Mr Hancock sought permission in early February to travel to Brussels to discuss the coronavirus with his EU counterparts, but was refused by Downing Street.

The UK retains access to the EWRS system until Jan 1 next year as part of it’s standstill “transition” deal.

The Government has said it will not extend the transition period, meaning that unless the UK takes a different tack in negotiations, its access will lapse.

Speaking last month Mr Dickson said: “Our worry is that all sides in these negotiations are under massive time pressures to agree a future trade deal and so there is a risk that the safety and health of patients and citizens across Europe could be overlooked.”

When the UK published its negotiation mandate last week, there was no mention of the EWRS, with a non-committal pledge to explore co-operation in “specific and narrowly defined areas where this is in the interest of both sides, for example on matters of health security”.

The senior Whitehall source said this pledge explicitly did not amount to seeking access to the EWRS and other bodies. “It was a vague commitment to information sharing, not access or participation in the EU system, which was knocked back,” the source added.

. I would like to share with you Experience so that more people who do n’t know the virus can better protect themselves.

### Wash your hands frequently

Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.

**Why?** Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.

### Maintain social distancing

Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.

**Why?** When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.

### Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth

**Why?** Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.

### Practice respiratory hygiene

Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.

**Why?** Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.

### If you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical care early

Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.

**Why?** National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.

### Stay informed and follow advice given by your healthcare provider

Stay informed on the latest developments about COVID-19. Follow advice given by your healthcare provider, your national and local public health authority or your employer on how to protect yourself and others from COVID-19.

**Why?** National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on whether COVID-19 is spreading in your area. They are best placed to advise on what people in your area should be doing to protect themselves.

# Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past 14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading

· Follow the guidance outlined above.

· Stay at home if you begin to feel unwell, even with mild symptoms such as headache and slight runny nose, until you recover. **Why?** Avoiding contact with others and visits to medical facilities will allow these facilities to operate more effectively and help protect you and others from possible COVID-19 and other viruses.

· If you develop fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical advice promptly as this may be due to a respiratory infection or other serious condition. Call in advance and tell your provider of any recent travel or contact with travelers. **Why?** Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also help to prevent possible spread of COVID-19 and other viruses.

If you have any questions, you can contact me and I hope to help you.

Believe me, there's no despair if you put your faith in Christ. He saves anyone who genuinely believes in His gift and asks to be saved. He didn't suffer and die on the cross for nothing.

&gt;dont start weirding everybody out with fake Christ talk. Christ was a follower of the one true path of God, he did it so well they renamed the way or the system of one absolute path, Christianity.

My Book says that God in the flesh died on the cross for all our wrongdoing so we could be forgiven. Otherwise God, as a perfect being, has to judge our sin for what it is. Sin cannot enter heaven. What part of this do you disagree with? Do you think you are righteous enough, through your magic, straightness, miracles and ""Nen"" to make it into heaven on your own? If so, where did you learn that? And why do you assume it's true over what the Bible says?

265,"The number of Chinese cellphone users dropped by 21 million in the past three months, Beijing authorities announced on March 19. Deaths due to the CCP virus may have contributed to the high number of account closings.  
  
Cellphones are an indispensable part of life in China.  
  
“The digitization level is very high in China. People can’t survive without a cellphone,” Tang Jingyuan, a U.S.-based China affairs commentator, told The Epoch Times on March 21. “Dealing with the government for pensions and social security, buying train tickets, shopping … no matter what people want to do, they are required to use cellphones.  
  
“The Chinese regime requires all Chinese to use their cellphones to generate a health code. Only with a green health code are Chinese allowed to move in China now. It’s impossible for a person to cancel his cellphone.”  
  
China introduced mandatory facial scans on Dec. 1, 2019, to confirm the identity of the person who registered the phone. As early as Sept. 1, 2010, China required all cellphone users to register phones with their real identification, by which the state can control people’s speech via its large-scale monitoring system.  
  
Furthermore, Chinese people’s bank accounts and social security accounts are bundled with their cellphone plans; apps on Chinese phones check SIM cards against the state’s database to make sure the number belongs to the user.  
  
Beijing first launched cellphone-based health codes on March 10. All people in China must install a cellphone app and register their personal health information. Then the app can generate a QR code, which appears in three colors, to classify the user’s health level. Red means the person has an infectious disease, yellow means the person might have one, and green means the person doesn’t.  
  
Beijing claimed that the health codes are intended to prevent the spread of the CCP virus, commonly known as novel coronavirus.  
  
China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) announced on March 19 the number of phone users in each province in February. Compared with the previous announcement, which was released on Dec. 18, 2019, for November 2019 data, both cellphone and landline users dropped dramatically. In the same period the year before, the number of users increased.  
  
The number of cellphone users decreased from 1.600957 billion to 1.579927 billion, a drop of 21.03 million. The number of landline users decreased from 190.83 million to 189.99 million, a drop of 840,000.  
  
In the previous February, the number increased. According to MIIT, the number of cellphone users increased in February 2019 from 1.5591 billion to 1.5835 billion, which is 24.37 million more. The number of landline users increased from 183.477 million to 190.118 million, which is 6.641 million more.  
  
According to China’s National Bureau of Statistics, the country’s population at the end of 2019 was 4.67 million larger than in 2018, reaching 1.40005 billion.  
  
The 2020 decrease in landline users may be due to the nationwide quarantine in February, during which small businesses were shut down. But the decrease in cellphone users can’t be explained in this way.  
  
According to the operation data of all three Chinese cellphone carriers, cellphone accounts increased in December 2019 but dropped steeply in 2020.  
  
China Mobile is the largest carrier, holding about 60 percent of the Chinese cellphone market. It reported that it gained 3.732 million more accounts in December 2019, but lost 0.862 million in January 2020 and 7.254 million in February 2020.  
  
China Mobile’s performance in the same months in 2019 was markedly different; it gained 2.411 million more accounts in January 2019 and 1.091 million more in February 2019.

China Telecom is the second-largest carrier, holding about 21 percent of the market. It gained 1.18 million users in December 2019, but lost 0.43 million users in January 2020 and 5.6 million users in February 2020.

In 2019, it gained 4.26 million in January and 2.96 million in February.

China Unicom, which hasn’t yet published the data for February, shares the same experience as the other two telecoms in January 2020 and in early 2019. The company lost 1.186 million users in January 2020, but gained 1.962 million users in February 2019 and 2.763 million users in January 2019.

China allows each adult to apply for at most five cellphone numbers. Since Feb. 10, the majority of Chinese students have taken online classes with a cellphone number due to their schools being ordered to stay closed. These students’ accounts are under their parents’ names, which means some parents needed to open a new cellphone account in February.  
  
Analyzing the Numbers  
  
The big question is whether the dramatic drop in cellphone accounts reflects the account closings of those who have died due to the CCP virus.  
  
“It’s possible that some migrant workers had two cellphone numbers before. One is from their hometown, and the other is from the city they work in. In February, they might close the number in the city they work in because they couldn’t go there,” Tang said. Typically, migrant workers would have gone to their home city for the Chinese New Year in January, and then travel restrictions would have prevented them from returning to the city where they held a job.  
  
However, because there is a basic monthly fee to hold a cellphone account in China, the majority of migrant workers—the lowest income group—are likely to only have one cellphone account.  
  
China had 288.36 million migrant workers as of April 2019, according to the Chinese National Bureau of Statistics.  
  
On March 17, Meng Wei, spokesman of China’s National Development and Reform Commission, said at a monthly press conference in Beijing that except for Hubei, all provinces reported that more than 90 percent of their businesses resumed operations. In Zhejiang, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Shandong, Guangxi, and Chongqing, almost all businesses resumed production.  
  
If both the number of migrant workers and the level of employment are accurate, more than 90 percent of migrant workers have gone back to work.  
  
The economic dislocation caused by shutdowns in China may have also led some people who have an extra cellphone to cancel it. With business poor or stopped, they may not want to carry the extra expense.  
  
“At present, we don’t know the details of the data. If only 10 percent of the cellphone accounts were closed because the users died because of the CCP virus, the death toll would be 2 million,” Tang said.  
  
The reported death toll in China doesn’t line up with what can otherwise be determined about the situation there.  
  
A comparison with the situation in Italy also suggests the Chinese death toll is significantly underreported. Italy adopted similar measures to those used by the Chinese regime. The CCP virus death toll in Italy of 4,825 translates to a death rate of 9 percent. In China, where a much larger population was exposed to the virus, the reported death toll of 3,265 translated to a death rate of only 4 percent, less than half that reported in Italy.  
  
Activities in the outbreak epicenter of Hubei Province seem to contradict the reported death toll in China. The seven funeral homes in the city of Wuhan were reported to be burning bodies 24 hours a day, seven days a week in late January. Hubei Province has used 40 mobile cremators, each capable of burning five tons of medical waste and bodies a day, since Feb. 16.  
  
Lacking data, the real death toll in China is a mystery. The cancellation of 21 million cellphones provides a data point that suggests the real number may be far higher than the official number.  
  
The Epoch Times refers to the novel coronavirus, which causes the disease COVID-19, as the CCP virus because the Chinese Communist Party’s coverup and mismanagement allowed the virus to spread throughout China and create a global pandemic.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
266,"Full article by [Laurie Garrett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurie_Garrett):

A few days ago I shared wine, cheese, and camaraderie with a small group of close friends, and sadly, after five excellent bottles of Côtes du Rhône wine, we said goodbye to one another, knowing we shall not again share company for many weeks, perhaps months. Yesterday my dearest neighbors knocked on the door, carts loaded with suitcases and boxes in tow, to wish me well for the duration of the great pandemic. We air-hugged, and I sadly watched them tromp off to their packed vehicle, abandoning New York City for their country home. As they wandered off, I said, “See you in September, I hope—or whenever things are normal again.”

For some countries—Italy, South Korea, and Singapore for example—the moment of decision and personal preparation has long since passed, and millions of people are stuck in place, watching their epidemic unfold. On the eve of St. Patrick’s Day, the mayor of San Francisco ordered her entire population to “shelter in place” for a few weeks: The window of opportunity to relocate has closed for residents of the Bay Area.

Whether you are reading this in your living room in Vancouver, office in London, or on a subway in New York City, you need to think hard, and fast, about two crucial questions: Where, and with whom, do you want to spend the next six to 12 weeks of your life, hunkered down for the epidemic duration? And what can you do to make that place as safe as possible for yourself and those around you?

Your time to answer those questions is very short—a few days, at most. Airports will close, trains will shut down, gasoline supplies may dwindle, and roadblocks may be set up. Nations are closing their borders, and as the numbers of sick rise, towns, suburbs, even entire counties will try to shut the virus out by blocking travel. Wherever you decide to settle down this week is likely to be the place in which you will be stuck for the duration of your epidemic.

To appreciate what lies ahead for the United States, Canada, Mexico, and the United Kingdom, pay heed to Italy, France, and Germany. The United States, for example, is currently tracking exactly where Italy was about 10 days ago. France and Germany, which track two to five days ahead of the United States, are now revving up measures akin to those taken by Italy, including lockdowns on movement and social activity. In a matter of days, the United States will follow suit.

If you live alone, have no family members or close friends who require your special attention, and have no alternative living space, you have no decision to make. You are where you will be for coming weeks.

Many households are now swelling as colleges and universities close, sending students to their parents’ homes, and young adults find themselves facing financial ruin amid the shutdown of theaters, restaurants, gig economy work, construction sites, and other forms of employment lacking job protection and home leave assistance. These young adults may also choose to return to their parents’ homes, or to secondary residences owned by friends or relatives.

As employers shift to work-from-home status, white-collar workers with salaried jobs need to consider where best to hunker down, allowing them strong Internet access and a home work setting. For workers whose jobs require physical presence at a work site, such as custodians, factory workers, security guards, construction personnel, taxi drivers, and the like, the relocation option is decided—stay put. But many may lose their jobs, either temporarily or permanently, due to the epidemic, and the prospect of six to eight weeks without an income stream is excruciating. Anybody facing that prospect should immediately negotiate with their landlords, mortgage lenders, and utilities, seeking long-term payment options, and scour for information regarding their legal rights if threatened with eviction, power shut-off, or lost credit due to epidemic-spawned nonpayment.

Because elderly people, particularly those with underlying medical conditions, are at special risk for severe reactions to COVID-19, including death, many families are making choices to move closer to their aged loved ones, or bring them to live with their adult children and grandchildren. These can be painful decisions, particularly if the elder’s health requires daily attention or features dementia. As the epidemic worsens, it will become increasingly dangerous for such elders to travel: Tough choices must be made immediately.

Once tough location decisions have been made, the household must be readied for a long siege. While panic-buying has led to stockpiles of toilet paper and hand sanitizer, getting through eight months of confinement with others will require a great deal more, both physically and psychologically. This is especially true for households that span generations.

Long-term confinement that includes children undergoing remote schooling and adults trying to work requires designated spaces for each individual, a powerful Internet signal and Wi-Fi router, and a great deal of shared patience. Everybody in the household must understand how the coronavirus is spread, and what steps each should follow to eliminate their personal risk of passing infection to others in the home.

The virus is transmitted by droplets and fomites—it isn’t like measles, capable of drifting about in the air for hours. It dehydrates quickly if not inside water, mucus, or fomite droplets. The size of the droplets may be far below what the human eye can see, but they are gravity-sensitive, and will fall from an individual’s mouth down, eventually, to the nearest lower surface—table, desk, floor. You do not need to clean upward.

However, a newly published study, backed by the National Institutes of Health, found that the virus survives in “aerosols for up to three hours, up to four hours on copper, up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel.” This means an uncleaned surface can pose a risk to members of the household for a very long time—a doorknob, tabletop, kitchen counter or stainless steel utensil.

Both the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Occupational Safety and Health Administration have posted cleaning guidelines, indicating which simple, inexpensive products can eliminate the coronavirus from surfaces in your household or work areas. Give special attention to the most commonly shared surfaces in your home or work area: door knobs, light switches, phones, faucets, toilet handles, kitchen utensils, computer keyboards, and remote controls.

The virus is killed by ultraviolet sunlight, and air flow will hasten dehydration. Do not create air flow by turning on building central air systems—you will spread contamination. If there are windows, open them wide and leave them open whenever weather conditions allow. If there are curtains or shades, open them and let sunlight pour in.

If available, wear latex or heavy-duty dishwashing gloves while cleaning anything that an individual suspected to be infected with COVID-19 has had contact with. Place all used gloves and other disposable contaminated items in a bag that can be tied closed before disposing of them with other waste. Wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds immediately after removing gloves.

If you live in an apartment, condominium, or co-housing facility, ask management to post signs limiting the number of people allowed to share an elevator to however many can fit in the cars while maintaining a distance of three feet from one another. Elevator buttons should be cleaned regularly. Deliveries should be left in a common area, such as the building lobby, rather than having outsiders use the elevators and knock on household doors.

And all residents should be asked to please be mindful of contagion courtesy, covering mouths when coughing or sneezing and teaching children to do the same. After coughing or sneezing into hands, do not touch public surfaces in the building such as elevator buttons, banisters, and door handles.

It’s also important to prepare psychologically. Every family or couple has its issues, and tensions can amplify during long confinement. Common sense can ease the shared suffering.

If children are undergoing remote schooling, and parents are simultaneously working remotely, everybody needs headphones, plenty of computer bandwidth, and a designated workspace. Before stores close, make sure every user has proper cables, headphones, batteries, adapters, and other tools of the computer trade.

Printers, if they will be used, require paper and ink: Have plenty on hand.

Everybody needs routines, including exercise and recreation. Shared burdens of cooking and cleaning should be offset by shared play and fun.

Boredom and stress can suck the lifeblood out of a person. Before your home goes on lockdown, make sure your download accounts for movies and television are paid. There are plenty of good books around the house, and games and decks of cards are handy.

Plan now for your state of siege. Don’t delay. Choose where you want to survive the pandemic, with whom, and how. Your window of opportunity to act is shrinking, very fast.",0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0

On balance, I'm actually much more anti Brexit and believe we should remain. I voted remain the first time around.

That being said, I also strongly feel that we've almost had two rounds of votes now and the public have clearly shown that they want out to mean out. Yea, it was close BUT that's the way the cookie crumbles and we have to respect democracy. So, as you can tell, my opinions on the matter are divided massively BUT as I said, I would still advocate for remain if I was pushed to choose.

What I was trying to get at, is the fact that whether you're leave or remain, people try and pin all the problems on the other side all the time. I'm in a unique position as I see the valid arguments from both sides of the fence and I'm divided on the issue. When I hear someone say ""watch the government blame all this shit on the coronavirus now, when in reality it's all Brexit's fault' I don't believe that's exactly fair or right.

This comes from someone who is politically far left leaning and I don't often give praise or credit to our current government. I get it, Brexit is probably making things worse than they would be, Brexit was always going to cause economic problems BUT all that being said, the coronavirus would have been a shitshow regardless of the Brexit issue. If we had of remained, things would still be going tits up right now.

I think pinning a big portion of blame on the coronavirus for current events and market troubles is FAIR. There will undoubtedly be events that unfold that are impacted and made worse because of the Brexit issue that the government will probably try and brush off and blame on Covid19 but I just wanted to be fair here, other countries that aren't being faced with the Brexit issue are currently facing a total shit show with their economies and other issues caused by the virus. So to say we can't put a lot of the blame (at least for current events) at the door of the virus, seems a little unfair to me.",0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0

But it's also an optimal transmitter for the corona virus, because it can survive on surfaces for [up to nine days](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-surfaces-explainer/explainer-how-long-can-coronavirus-survive-on-surfaces-idUSKCN20M3BK). **The Chinese already know this**, that's why they have literally started to [quarantine cash](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-15/china-quarantines-cash-to-sanitize-old-bank-notes-from-virus) two weeks ago. That being said, the Chinese in general shifted their preferred method of payment from cash to online/contactless (like Wechat Pay) over the last years. But **a cash-dependent society could see a drastically worse outcome than China**, because we are dealing with an exponential process - a cashier in a supermarket could potentially infect hundreds of customers per day.

And cash is *huge* in Europe. The [global cash index (pdf)](https://www.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/The-Global-Cash-Index-Middle-East-And-South-Africa-Analysis-January-2018.pdf) - the source of the picture linked - tells us that the relative ratio of cash payments is more than twice as high in Italy than in the US. In Germany and Austria, it's even higher. In Vienna, you can't even pay with card in many restaurants, bars or cafés. Austrians also greet themselves affectionately, often with kisses left and right. Furthermore, public transportation is (unlike in the US) working very well and everybody uses it. I therefore suspect that the infection rates in Vienna, but also Germany and Switzerland (also cash crazy, and they even do three kisses when greeting) will rise at a much higher rate than for example in Northern Europe. There, the situation is different. Contactless payment is strong and people greet themselves less affectionate, in some situations don't even shake hands (depending on the country). Therefore I suspect the virus will not spread as quickly there, although temperatures might be colder for a longer time.

In the meantime, **try to avoid paying with cash**. We *know* bank notes are contaminated. We *know* the virus can stay on surfaces for days. We *know* the Chinese are quarantining bank notes.

271,"&gt;The Chinese government has now shut down transportation in the huge city of Wuhan, where the supposedly deadly coronavirus first surfaced a few months ago. Where? At an open air fish and meat market. Anyone looking into contaminated flesh at the market? Dangerous lack of sanitation? They’re looking into “the virus.” Naturally. 

&gt;And as I keep saying in past and recent articles, we have a massive tradition of FAKE EPIDEMICS.

&gt;You have to understand: most people don’t want to hear this. It’s rather astonishing. Most people feel compelled to believe in the virus, believe it’s dangerous, it’s a killer, it’s real, it’s a global threat. Pro-vaccine people, anti-vaccine people, it doesn’t matter. They salute THE VIRUS.

&gt;[In my last article](https://blog.nomorefakenews.com/2020/01/22/is-the-new-deadly-china-virus-a-covert-operation/), I detailed how former “epidemics,” SARS (coronavirus) and Swine Flu, turned out to be complete fakes. Eventually, it leaked out that medical experts couldn’t find the virus in people. You should really read that article, and read it again. And think about the implications.

&gt;Medical research honchos and the press are still calling the 2003 SARS dud an epidemic. Official stats indicate 800 people died, worldwide. If that’s an epidemic, there are pink tigers walking around on the far side of the moon.

&gt;Now, when they talk about rushing a vaccine into production “against the virus,” that’s a whole different story. They tried that in 2009 with Swine Flu, and it caused profound and horrific results. I’ve read the patent info that’s now circulating on the Web—for a vaccine against a coronavirus. It’s hard to tell, but it could be a DNA vaccine. If it is, that means the vaccine will permanently alter the genetic makeup of anyone who takes the shot.

&gt;Here’s something else you should think about. The so-called origin points of epidemics. SARS (2003), the Amoy Gardens apartment complex in Hong Kong. Swine Flu (2009), a giant commercial pig farm in La Gloria, Mexico. And now, in 2020, the Chinese coronavirus, an open air animal and fish market in Wuhan.

&gt;At the Amy Gardens complex, there were leaks in the pipes. Human waste was leaking. People were falling ill. My, what a surprise. They needed to call in a plumber, not the World Health Organization virus hunters.

&gt;At the pig farm, in La Gloria, huge feces lagoons, yes, were lying there out in the sun. The lagoons were routinely sprayed with toxic chemicals. Workers were falling ill. What a shock. So they brought in people to spray even more toxic chemicals on the pig shit lagoons. They needed a major environmental clean-up. Instead, they got World Health and CDC virus hunters.

&gt;And now, in Wuhan, the virus hunters are at it again. They want to test the animal flesh at the market for viruses. Here are a few recommendations. Check the water supply in the market. Is it dirty? Check the refrigeration. Are the fish and animal meat always fresh? Is the place clean? Is it washed down well every day? Actually LOOK at the premises. I know, it’s a revolutionary act, but steel yourself and go ahead.

&gt;“Yes, but what about the other cases of the China coronavirus that have been identified in other countries? Where did they come from?”

&gt;Answer: How do you know these other cases are a result of the coronavirus? The symptoms in most of these fake epidemics are the same—they’re basic flu symptoms—fatigue, fever, cough, weakness. A person could come down with THAT for a hundred different reasons.

&gt;I started writing about viruses that were never proved to cause human illness—or weren’t even there to begin with—in 1987. All these years later, I find myself still doing it. Why?

&gt;**BECAUSE ‘THE VIRUS” IS THE GREATEST COVER STORY ON THE PLANET. IT ATTRACTS BELIEVERS FROM WALL TO WALL.**

&gt;Professionals invoke it to cover up a multitude of crimes.

&gt;For example, in parts of Africa, where the water supplies are contaminated to the hilt, where people are hungry and dying of starvation, where people have chronic diarrhea and are dying from dehydration, where extreme poverty and war for economic gain are routine, where corporate interests are stealing farm land from the people and poisoning the environment, where toxic medical drugs and vaccines are killing people whose immune systems are already compromised—you can ignore all that because…the real problem, the one serious problem, you see, is:

&gt;**THE VIRUS.**

&gt;Sure. Pump up that story to the max, get medical testimony, research money, the whole insane apparatus, and paint over what is actually happening there, and you’re in. You’re in control. You’re king.

Considering hundreds of Italians are dying daily simply because they don't have machines available and considering the greater strain this is putting on hospitals elsewhere , and killing more than the flu, this is bad.

Here's some numbers (Italy's seems higher due to straining of services which can easily happen here):

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.vox.com/platform/amp/2020/3/23/21190033/coronavirus-covid-19-deaths-by-age


Adults up to middle age (30 to 49 years old)
The important stats on this working-age population:

In Spain, out of 5,127 cases from this cohort, 1,028 people have been hospitalized, a 20 percent rate; 55 went to the ICU, a 1.1 percent rate; and three people ages 30 to 49 have died, a 0.2 percent fatality rate.
Italy (0.3 percent death rate), China (0.2 percent), and South Korea (0.1 percent) have reported deaths in this age range.
As mentioned above, the CDC covers one huge 20-44 age range in its report, but here’s what we know about that group: 14.3 percent hospitalized, 2 percent in the ICU, and 0.1 percent fatality rate.
For people 45 to 54, the CDC reports 21.2 percent have been hospitalized, 5.4 percent were put in the ICU, and 0.5 percent have died.

Bottom line: For this demographic, a significant number of people are being hospitalized, upward of one in five cases. And those final numbers from the CDC are a good example of how risk can vary within these age groups: Odds of hospitalization, intensive care, and death seem to increase from one’s early 40s to late 40s. We’ve seen the same trend in Spain: The rates of hospitalization jumped from 17 percent for ages 30 to 39 to 23 percent for ages 40 to 49.


People nearing retirement age (50 to 69 years old)
The important stats on the people entering their golden years:

In Spain, out of 6,045 cases from this cohort, 2,166 people have been hospitalized, a 36 percent hospitalization rate; 221 went to the ICU, a 3.7 percent rate; and 83 people ages 50 to 69 have died, a 1.4 percent fatality rate.
Taken collectively, Italy, China, and South Korea have reported fatality rates from 0.4 percent up to 3.6 percent for people in this group.
For people 45 to 54, the CDC reports 21.2 percent have been hospitalized, 5.4 percent were put in the ICU, and 0.5 percent have died. For people 55 to 64, 20.5 percent have been hospitalized, 4.7 percent ended up in the ICU, and 1.4 percent died. For the oldest folks in this group, ages 65 to 74, hospitalizations (28.6 percent), ICU stays (8.1 percent) and deaths (2.7 percent) continue to trend upward.

Young adults (20 to 29 years old)
The important stats on young adults:

In Spain, out of 1,285 cases for people 20 to 29 (a much bigger sample size than we have for children), 183 of them have been hospitalized, a 14 percent rate; eight have ended up in intensive care, a 0.6 percent rate, and four people in this age range have died, a 0.3 percent fatality rate.
Italy and South Korea have reported no fatalities for this group; China reports that 0.2 percent of cases for these young people end in death.
The CDC covers a huge 20-44 age range in its data, but here’s what we know about that entire group: 14.3 percent hospitalized, 2 percent in the ICU, and 0.1 percent fatality rate.""

The Palace wishes to inform the public that President Rodrigo Roa Duterte has been apprised by our health officials about the decision to raise the Code Alert System for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the country to Code Red Sublevel 2.

Following discussions with health officials, as well as with members of the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF), the Chief Executive has decided to approve the imposition of Stringent Social Distancing Measures in the National Capital Region (NCR) for thirty (30) days, with the salient directives discussed below.

First, the suspension of classes in all levels in Metro Manila is extended until April 12, 2020, with students remaining in their respective homes for the said duration.

Second, mass gatherings, defined as events where the number of people attending could strain the planning and response resources of the community hosting the event, shall be prohibited during the aforesaid period.

Third, community quarantine is imposed in the entire Metro Manila. Local Government Units (LGUs) in other areas are advised to abide by the following guidelines:
•	A barangay-wide quarantine is advised when there at least two (2) positive COVID-19 cases belonging to different households in the same barangay;
•	A municipality/city-wide quarantine is advised when there at least two (2) positive COVID-19 cases belonging to different barangays in the same municipality/city;
•	A province-wide quarantine is advised when there at least two (2) positive COVID-19 cases belonging to different municipalities, component cities or independent component cities in the same province; and
•	LGUs, which have imposed community quarantine in their respective jurisdiction/s, upon the declaration of a State of Calamity, shall be allowed to access their Quick Response Fund.

Fourth, work in the Executive Branch shall be suspended during the same period, without prejudice to the formation of skeletal workforces by government agencies. The Congress and the Judiciary are encouraged to adopt the same policy. Law enforcement agencies, including the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Philippine National Police, as well as health and emergency frontline services shall continue in full operation.

Fifth, flexible work arrangements shall likewise be encouraged in the private sector, following guidelines from the Department of Labor and Employment and the Department of Trade and Industry designed to safeguard the welfare of the workers. All manufacturing, retail and service establishments shall remain in operation during the same period, provided that strict social distancing measures are observed.

Sixth, mass public transports, such as the Light Rail Transits, the Metro Rail Transits, and the Philippine National Railway shall continue in operation, following guidelines by the Department of Transportation intended to ensure social distancing.

Seventh, land, domestic air, and domestic sea travel to and from Metro Manila shall be suspended beginning March 15, 2020 00:00H until April 14, 2020 23:59H.

All the aforementioned measures shall be subject to daily monitoring and reassessment by the IATF.

In addition, LGUs outside of the National Capital Region are advised to exercise sound discretion in suspending classes in their respective localities.

The President likewise approved that Balik-Manggagawa Overseas Filipino Workers may be allowed to travel to mainland China, except to Hubei Province, upon their execution of a declaration signifying their knowledge and understanding of the risks involved in their travel. A health advisory pamphlet shall similarly be handed to them upon their departure.

Finally, entry travel restrictions shall be imposed upon those traveling from countries with localized COVID-19 transmissions, except for Filipino citizens including their foreign spouse and children, if any, holders of permanent resident visa, and holders of diplomatic visas issued by the Philippine Government.

To be clear, and to allay the fears and apprehension of the public, the government is essentially calling for a stricter implementation of preventive measures in order to slow down and put a halt to the further spread of COVID-19. While a total and absolute lockdown is considered by some as a valid preventive measure, current circumstances do not warrant such an extreme course of action. 

While the Duterte Administration remains resolute in combating this disease, the Palace asks affected entities and individuals for their cooperation in properly observing the foregoing adopted measures.

**Coronavirus: More infected South Tyrol tourists**

At least five other South Tyrol tourists from Germany are infected with the corona virus. The State Health Office of Baden-Württemberg confirmed five cases in the Esslingen district, in Ulm and in the Zollernalb district.

More and more cases of people who tested positive for the corona virus after a stay in South Tyrol are becoming known from Germany. Five new cases have been reported from Baden-Württemberg.

According to Südwestrundfunk radio, two corona cases in the Esslingen district, south-east of Stuttgart, were caused by a couple who stayed in South Tyrol at the end of February. An 18-year-old man from the Esslingen district was also in South Tyrol with his family, according to the state health office.

The Ministry of Health in Baden-Wuerttemberg also reported another case from the Ludwigsburg district, north of Stuttgart. According to the information, a 45-year-old travel returnee from South Tyrol with a slight flu-like infection presented himself to the family doctor there.

It is unclear exactly where the tourists were staying

Two further cases of infection from Baden-Württemberg had previously become known. The case involves a 61-year-old man from the Zollernalb district who was in South Tyrol with a group of tourists on a skiing trip. The second case concerns a 45-year-old woman from Ulm who also went to South Tyrol for a skiing holiday.

Where exactly the tourists stayed in South Tyrol is not yet known. Yesterday, Governor Arno Kompatscher had already confirmed four cases of German holidaymakers from Berlin, Brandenburg and Lower Saxony who had been in Selva and Welsberg. For this reason, the state governor issued an emergency decree for six communities in the upper Puster Valley and the Ladin valleys.

&gt;**Concert halls in emergency consultation after advice to cancel major events: ""Keep your tickets still""
Several concert organizers and cultural organizations are holding urgent consultations now that the federal government has advised that indoor events with more than 1,000 people should no longer take place in order to prevent and delay the spread of the corona virus in our country as much as possible. The government's advice is provisionally valid until the end of March. The Brussels Region is already imposing a ban from tomorrow. For the other provinces, clarity may not come until Wednesday.**

 
&gt;Interior Minister Pieter De Crem met with the provincial governors in his cabinet this evening. Together with the mayors, they will have to enforce the measure on the ground. Consultations were reportedly ""constructive"" but concrete measures or decisions will not be announced until tomorrow.

&gt;The measure applies provisionally for the entire month of March. The ball is now in the camp of the governors and mayors, who can now decide to let an event go ahead anyway.

&gt;The insurance umbrella Assuralia has already fired a shot at organizers: if they organize indoor events of more than 1,000 people, they can be held liable if they do not behave as a prudent organization. In other words, they risk a claim for damages if someone at such an event would become infected with corona.

&gt;**Ban in Brussels Region from tomorrow until March 31**
&gt;While it is still some waiting before the Flemish provinces decide on the ban, the Brussels Region has already banned all events that take place indoors and in which more than 1,000 people are present. That has been decided by Prime Minister Rudy Vervoort (PS). The measure will take effect from tomorrow and will run until March 31. Prime Minister Vervoort will as soon as possible deposit a regional decision that will apply in the 19 Brussels municipalities.

Now, while I find this perfectly believable as most people who have received the training you have doesn't change that they're largely morons, the attitude you are taking now points to more likely you're just posing and think it is going to mean anything as you're talking as if you've found some common talking point.

The thing with masks is that they simply will not protect you from coronavirus. Truly what will protect you from the coronavirus is absolute self-isolation in a home with all the doors locked and this is the only way you will survive without having the virus, my sweet innocent little medical professional of certain intelligence. I'm afraid that you being a professional doesn't mean anything.

The masks which possibly reduce droplets you are expelling and so may protect certain people at a certain distance from you and protect yourself from bits of spit in your face is in practice just as good as people trained to use the the golden standard of air filtration nose-fitted mask which the n95 claims it sticks all around your mouth so technically the viruses and bacteria don't pass through this mask but only molecules of air so no biological material that's alive will pass through the filter. But in practice you find yourself with huge problems of that when you get infected such as a cloud of contaminated particles generated from whatever event happen to bei n the pocket of air you are going to inhale from and often if you inhale 100% you will be infected, and if you inhale 1% you will be infected, let alone wearing these masks all day and the effect your breath over that time will have on their supposed perfect standard filtration unit construction over time, and that if you're going in public with these n95 masks your hands have the coronavirus all over them, your shirt has the coronavirus, and you're going to have to remove this mask at some point, you're fingers have it, you touch yourself, you don't clean yourself or if you do clean yourself you don't clean yourself enough.
The n95 mask is only working in an ideal scenario. You're not in an ideal scenario if you're not a doctor with staff around you who remove your mask such as I'm holding my hands in the air while my assistant is attaching my sterile gloves and attaching my robe in my back. If you're not in that situation the n95 doesn't mean much. And so you're going to end up at home and even if you were to filter out the virus (which if it does you'd be okay anyway, and if it doesn't you'd simply be similarly infected anyway) you're going to give it to your family. So masks are just not a good strategy here.

I've seen the strategy used by some people in Wuhan of being in a complete transparent garbage bag and having a small place in the bottom to breathe from. I would say this may be more efficient than the n95 in certain scenarios, but not really. Better yet you can look cool like you don't care, and better you can wear sun glasses which really are more effective than any mask or garbage suit and look very cool wearing sun glasses.

Meanwhile trained medical personel wearing legitimate n95 professionally kept being handled by assistant with sterilised hands and you have your arms out and they put the mask on for your and then remove it for you - these people are getting infected. So you know I'm afraid to inform you that you're going to have to get fucking real my friend, but thanks for reminding me of the quality of intelligence we have working throughout.

The doctors who died from coronavirus they had the n95 and they had a brand new legitimate one with filtration unit built maybe even to standards claimed (which is bs and even if true in practice is not going to prevent all the smaller particles coming through) and not breathed on for hours and everything, and they knew how to wash their hands, and they had the glasses, but it's not enouguh, and where are many of them now my sweet little darling? They're dead.

Because this virus is coming for your little butt hole and there is not shit you can do about it unless you quarantine yourself in your bank vault and do not allow anyone in. And if you were properly informed and had the intelligence to process that information you'd know that there's no point in telling people to wear masks, it's a complete joke. But all you know is how important they've told you it is to wipe down phones and to look at numbers and say one is bigger than the other without understanding context.

You just look like a mug in your mask. There isn't some cabal of lizards lying to you, the experts are simply telling you the truth of that masks don't really make any difference to average joe and there's not any point in wearing one to try and protect yourself from the virus.",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
281,"**GC seats**

proportional system we normally get 55-60% of the vote, with this I would assume we will get 60-65% of the vote (so 60-65% of 35 so 21-23 geographic constituencies).

This is because in previous DC elections Pro-dems get 40% of the public vote, but in the recent election we got 57%, that along with gov loosing even more popularity since then cus of their lack of competence with dealing with the outbreak of covid 19 is why I think for GC's pro-dems will get 60-65% of the vote.

**DC 2nd**

Normally we win 3/5 of DC2'nd seats, (which everyone in HK vote for), I think we can either maintain the 3/5 or even get 4/5 (so that's a total of 24-27 seats).

**DC 1st**

+1 for DC1st because we got a majority in all the DC's (apart from Islands (which raises the total seat count to 25-28).

**Other safe FCs:**

+1 Legal (always Pro-dem - making seat count total to 26-29)

+1 Education (always Pro-dem - making seat count total 27-30)

+1 Accountancy (big majority pro-dem - making seat count total 28-31)

+1 Health Services (big majority pro-dem - making seat count total 29-32)

+1 Social Welfare (always has been pro-dem - making seat count total 30-33)

+1 Information Technology (big pro-dem majority - making seat count total 31-34)

+1 Medial (Pro-dem seat currently, most likely going to remain pro-dem seat because of Govt's incompetence with dealing with the covid 19 outbreak (making the seat count total 32-35 ((**possible majority reached**))

**Battleground FCs:**

Architectural, Surveying, Planning and Landscape - Won in 2016, its rep was dq'd cus of oath taking controversy so there was a re-election and the pro-beijing won by 10%, I would put the chances of Pro-dem camp winning this at 60-70% (making the seat count total 33-36 )

Wholesale and Retail - Pro-dem candidate gets around 35% of the vote, however as this constituency has a majority of individuals, instead of corporate voters (like the majority of other FC's), I would put the chances of the pro-dem camp winning this seat at 45%-60% (making the seat count total 34-37)

Catering - Though the pro-dem candidates used to only get around 20-25% of the vote, thanks to the yellow economic circle hundreds of new restaurants are joining this FC *and* old restaurants who used to vote Pro-beijing just because of the economy, changing to pro-democracy as they dont want the Pro-beijing camp retaining their majority - there's also a lot of public activism trying to persuade restaurants to vote yellow in the election. I put the chances of the pro-dem winning this at 60-65% (making the seat count total 35-38).


Labour - Labour Im not that sure, Ive heard from different sources that you will need your union to be eligible to vote, however, I still think that atleast one of the 3 Labour seats will turn, I'd give the chances of that happening at 35-55% (making the seat count total 36-39).

""In the nightmare of the coronavirus pandemic that is unfolding around the world, parents have been able to take comfort in one thing — early reports that the virus mysteriously spares children even as it often causes critical illness in the elderly.
A paper released this week in the journal Pediatrics, based on 2,143 young people in China, provides the most extensive evidence on the spread of the virus in children, and there is bad news and good news.
The study provides confirmation that coronavirus infections are in fact generally less severe in kids, with more than 90 percent having mild to moderate disease or even being asymptomatic. But it contains worrisome information about one subset — infants — and suggests that children may be a critical factor in the disease’s rapid spread.
AD

The first thing to know is that children are getting infected across all age groups and genders. Among the patients studied, half were from Hubei Province, the epicenter of the outbreak, while the others were from bordering areas. They ranged in age from newborns to 18 with the median age being 7 years.
So what does coronavirus look like in children?
Surge in coronavirus patients threatens to swamp U.S. hospitals

According to the analysis by Shanghai Children’s Medical Center researchers Yuanyuan Dong, Xi Mo and co-authors, mild cases (52 percent) were marked by the typical symptoms of a cold — fever, fatigue, cough, sore throat, runny nose and sneezing. Some patients had no fever and only digestive symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea.
AD

Those with moderate infection (39 percent) had pneumonia with frequent fever and cough, mostly dry cough, followed by a wetter cough. Some had wheezing but no obvious shortness of breath.
Severe cases were rare (5 percent) as were those who required critical care (0.4 percent.) The severe cases began with early respiratory symptoms which were sometimes accompanied by gastrointestinal issues. Around one week the children have more difficulty breathing. Those cases sometimes quickly progressed to critical illness with acute respiratory distress or failure which in turn sometimes led to other organ dysfunction — heart failure or kidney injury.
One boy, a 14-year-old, died on Feb. 7. No further details on the patient were revealed in the study.
AD

Of special interest to pediatricians is a group of seven infants (11 percent of the total number of infants in the study), and two children in the age 1 to 5 range (15 percent), who progressed to critical condition. The study suggests, the authors wrote, that “young children, particularly infants, were vulnerable.”
The luckiest group — 4 percent — did not have any symptoms at all even as nasal or throat swabs showed they were positive for coronavirus infection.
“Why most of the children’s COVID-19 cases were less severe than adults’ case is puzzling,” Dong and Mo wrote. “This may be related to both exposure and host factors.""
The researchers wrote that children may have been more isolated at home after the outbreak began, and therefore had fewer opportunities to be exposed to the pathogens. They also suggested that there was something in the children’s biology — a cell receptor that binds to the virus — that might be less sensitive. Another theory is that children often experience colds and other respiratory infections in winter so they may have come into the season with higher levels of antibodies, which are protective, than adults.
AD

The Pediatrics editors wrote they were releasing the paper early, within days of it having been peer reviewed but before official publication, due to the topic’s importance. In a commentary accompanying the study, associate editors Andrea Cruz and Steve Zeichner, both physicians, say the study suggests “children may play a major role in community-based viral transmission.”
The data suggests they may have more symptoms that make them contagious, like runny nose, and that they may have more gastrointestinal symptoms which raises concerns for the virus being in the feces for several weeks after infection.
How to manage screen time for kids as coronavirus closes schools

As schools move to online teaching, students will be spending extra time in front of a screen. Clinical psychologist Nicole Beurkens has some pointers. (Allie Caren/The Washington Post)
“Prolonged shedding in nasal secretions and stool has substantial implications for community spread in day-care centers, schools, and in the home,” Cruz, a pediatrician from the Baylor College of Medicine, and Zeichner, an immunologist from the University of Virginia, wrote.
AD

Adam Ratner, a doctor in pediatric infectious diseases at NYU Langone Health, said the outbreak in China represents only a small percentage of those who will eventually become infected and when the group gets larger “we’ll see more serious cases on the fringes.”
He said the clear takeaway from the study is that coronavirus “is still something that has the ability to cause severe disease across the age spectrum.” He said his hospital and his colleagues’ around the United States were “taking the idea of covid-19 in children very seriously.”
“We’re learning more and more about this disease every day for better or for worse,” he said. “It’s still very early days.”",0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
283,"Thank you for the comment.  

Japanese MHLW had also originally reported very incomplete numbers, but they has  finally forced to publish somewhat more or less accurate figures, in accordance at least largely with those of other countries, since Mar. 04 (Yes, very recently), after repeated criticisms from the different medias as well as several slips of the tongue of politicians who made use of 'unofficial' secret figures.   

Even opposition parties once published their 'unofficial' statistics, based on interviews from all the relevant local authorities, as I posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fdvhlf/japan_japans_opposition_parties_cdp_and_so_on/).   

These efforts resulted in the disclosure of the more accurate tested numbers in Japan, just a few days ago. ~~Now instead MHLW's official twitter account of begins to attack some 'misinformation', or 'misunderstanding' of their official policy, though.~~ 

So, please don't give up, and keep asking CDC for more information transparency.   

I've read the history book on the Spanish flu, and it narrates that one of the great achievements of CDC in US during that period is to collect the accurate figures from individual local authority as well as to publish them regularly to the public by radio.

I’ve been looking into surgical masks for many months, in November before covid19 was a thing. After weeks of research into the literature, and talking with medical profs in my family, and reading online, it’s become rather clear to me that the CDC position about the ineffectiveness of surgical masks for genpop looks right. The CDC does not recommend genpop wear surgical masks. We can debate references and linked articles all day long. The question you have to ask yourself is if you believe and trust the CDC on the matter. I happen to trust my brother and sister-in-law who work at some of the best hospitals in the US, especially when their guidance matches the CDC’s, and they show me the literature and explain the pitfalls of genpop use of surgical masks.

1. A frontline doctor’s general description of symptoms for the Covid’s first three weeks of illness, and

2. A day by day description of symptoms (from day 1 through day 12) and treatment for the first patient in the USA. He began feeling ill on Jan. 15, was admitted to the hospital on Jan. 20th, and was released from the hospital Feb. 3rd/4.

Symptoms explained by Doctor ihttps://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/reporters-notebook-life-and-death-in-a-wuhan-coronavirus-icu: and The JAMA https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2761044

“I've observed that the breakout period of the novel coronavirus tends to be three weeks, from the onset of symptoms to developing difficulties breathing. Basically going from mild to severe symptoms takes about a week. There are all sorts of mild symptoms: feebleness, shortness of breath, some people have fevers, some don't. Based on studies of our 138 cases, the most common symptoms in the first stage are fever (98.6 per cent of cases), feebleness (69.6 per cent), cough (59.4 per cent), muscle pains (34.8 per cent), difficulties breathing (31.2%), while less common symptoms include headaches, dizziness, stomach pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting.

But some patients who enter the second week will suddenly get worse. At this stage, people should go to the hospital. The elderly with underlying conditions may develop complications; some may need machine-assisted respiration. When the body's other organs start to fail, that's when it becomes severe, while those with strong immune systems see their symptoms decrease in severity at this stage and gradually recover. So the second week is what determines whether the illness becomes critical.

The third week determines whether critical illness leads to death. Some in critical condition who receive treatment can raise their level of lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell, and see an improvement in their immune systems, and have been brought back, so to speak. But those whose lymphocyte numbers continue to decline, those whose immune systems are destroyed in the end, experience multiple organ failure and die.

For most, the illness is over in two weeks, whereas for those for whom the illness becomes severe, if they can survive three weeks, they're good. Those that can't will die in three weeks.”

Symptom Progression Day 1 to Day 12 From
First Case of 2019 Novel Coronavirus in the United States 

35 year old male

https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001191

On January 19, 2020, a 35-year-old man presented to an urgent care clinic in Snohomish County, Washington, with a 4-day history of cough and subjective fever. On checking into the clinic, the patient put on a mask in the waiting room. After waiting approximately 20 minutes, he was taken into an examination room and underwent evaluation by a provider. He disclosed that he had returned to Washington State on January 15 after traveling to visit family in Wuhan, China. The patient stated that he had seen a health alert from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) about the novel coronavirus outbreak in China and, because of his symptoms and recent travel, decided to see a health care provider....

Given the patient’s travel history, the local and state health departments were immediately notified. Together with the urgent care clinician, the Washington Department of Health notified the CDC Emergency Operations Center. Although the patient reported that he had not spent time at the Huanan seafood market and reported no known contact with ill persons during his travel to China, CDC staff concurred with the need to test the patient for 2019-nCoV on the basis of current CDC “persons under investigation” case definitions.8 Specimens were collected in accordance with CDC guidance and included serum and nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens. After specimen collection, the patient was discharged to home isolation with active monitoring by the local health department.
On January 20, 2020, the CDC confirmed that the patient’s nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs tested positive for 2019-nCoV by real-time reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction (rRT-PCR) assay. In coordination with CDC subject-matter experts, state and local health officials, emergency medical services, and hospital leadership and staff, the patient was admitted to an airborne-isolation unit at Providence Regional Medical Center for clinical observation, with health care workers following CDC recommendations for contact, droplet, and airborne precautions with eye protection.

On admission, the patient reported persistent dry cough and a 2-day history of nausea and vomiting; he reported that he had no shortness of breath or chest pain. Vital signs were within normal ranges. On physical examination, the patient was found to have dry mucous membranes. The remainder of the examination was generally unremarkable. After admission, the patient received supportive care, including 2 liters of normal saline and ondansetron for nausea.


On days 2 through 5 of hospitalization (days 6 through 9 of illness), the patient’s vital signs remained largely stable, apart from the development of intermittent fevers accompanied by periods of tachycardia (Figure 2). The patient continued to report a nonproductive cough and appeared fatigued. On the afternoon of hospital day 2, the patient passed a loose bowel movement and reported abdominal discomfort. A second episode of loose stool was reported overnight; a sample of this stool was collected for rRT-PCR testing, along with additional respiratory specimens (nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal) and serum. The stool and both respiratory specimens later tested positive by rRT-PCR for 2019-nCoV, whereas the serum remained negative.

Treatment during this time was largely supportive. For symptom management, the patient received, as needed, antipyretic therapy consisting of 650 mg of acetaminophen every 4 hours and 600 mg of ibuprofen every 6 hours. He also received 600 mg of guaifenesin for his continued cough and approximately 6 liters of normal saline over the first 6 days of hospitalization.


A chest radiograph taken on hospital day 3 (illness day 7) was reported as showing no evidence of infiltrates or abnormalities (Figure 3). However, a second chest radiograph from the night of hospital day 5 (illness day 9) showed evidence of pneumonia in the lower lobe of the left lung (Figure 4). These radiographic findings coincided with a change in respiratory status starting on the evening of hospital day 5, when the patient’s oxygen saturation values as measured by pulse oximetry dropped to as low as 90% while he was breathing ambient air. On day 6, the patient was started on supplemental oxygen, delivered by nasal cannula at 2 liters per minute. Given the changing clinical presentation and concern about hospital-acquired pneumonia, treatment with vancomycin (a 1750-mg loading dose followed by 1 g administered intravenously every 8 hours) and cefepime (administered intravenously every 8 hours) was initiated.


On hospital day 6 (illness day 10), a fourth chest radiograph showed basilar streaky opacities in both lungs, a finding consistent with atypical pneumonia (Figure 5), and rales were noted in both lungs on auscultation. Given the radiographic findings, the decision to administer oxygen supplementation, the patient’s ongoing fevers, the persistent positive 2019-nCoV RNA at multiple sites, and published reports of the development of severe pneumonia3,4 at a period consistent with the development of radiographic pneumonia in this patient, clinicians pursued compassionate use of an investigational antiviral therapy. Treatment with intravenous remdesivir (a novel nucleotide analogue prodrug in development10,11) was initiated on the evening of day 7, and no adverse events were observed in association with the infusion. Vancomycin was discontinued on the evening of day 7, and cefepime was discontinued on the following day, after serial negative procalcitonin levels and negative nasal PCR testing for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

On hospital day 8 (illness day 12), the patient’s clinical condition improved. Supplemental oxygen was discontinued, and his oxygen saturation values improved to 94 to 96% while he was breathing ambient air. The previous bilateral lower-lobe rales were no longer present. His appetite improved, and he was asymptomatic aside from intermittent dry cough and rhinorrhea. 

As of January 30, 2020, the patient remains hospitalized. He is afebrile, and all symptoms have resolved with the exception of his cough, which is decreasing in severity.

Russia refuses the return flight - the Kramp-Karrenbauer reacts

Instead, the plane was redirected to Helsinki to exchange and refuel the crew, said Defense Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer (CDU) on Saturday in Bonn. “We had the overflight permit and the landing permit was also promised. It has developed differently now. ""

&gt;It was important that the tank was refueled in Helsinki and that the crew could be replaced, said Kramp-Karrenbauer. ""What are the reasons next to the official declaration of insufficient capacity at the airport in Moscow, we will certainly discuss it with the Federal Foreign Office next week.""

293,"I get what you are saying here.  We are in the midst of some freaky stuff that few of us have seen before.  But, this isn't Pearl Harbor, and, unlike the Philippines, the US has the resources to deal with COVID and continue existing.  If we can get over the panic, and the federal government can get it act together, we will be fine.  There have been some good signs the past two days.

A big reason we have panic in the US is mistrust in the federal government.  It doesn't help that the guy at the top of the executive branch has been lying non-stop about things big and small for the past 3 years.  But, isn't just the guy at the top - it's been a team sport, including subordinates,  a large TV network, a series of smaller radio networks, and ""teammates"" in other branches who echo the lies to maintain their status and position (i.e. not lose the upcoming election).

So, as usual, the federal government's first response to COVID was to do what it has been to date.  Lying.  This included muzzling public health officials, downplaying the severity both in message and action (get people off the boat in Japan but don't test them or give government employees helping the evacuation any protective gear, training, or process as defined by the CDC), selectively blaming countries and states that aren't popular with its voting base (China, Mexico, Washington State), denying care and testing in an effort to keep the ""numbers"" down (No test kits, keep a cruise ship full of Americans from docking in a US port), and putting science deniers in charge of containment in an attempt to control the ""messaging"" (Priority One: Don't expose the lies).

Many of us Americans have overlooked the lies in the past, because there really haven't been crises that affect most of our day to day lives for the past three years.  But now shits real.  We are acknowledging the charade through a stock market crash and panic buying of toilet paper.

Some parts of the government have started acting sanely.  It started with state governments who clearly saw the US federal government had no clue.  This included governments from both ""teams"", ""Red States"" and ""Blue States"", doing what they could to enact sane and rational containment plans.  The CDC finally started speaking out and, *gasp,* contradicting the administration's messaging.  When the thing the administration really cares about (the stock market) starting getting sick, it started taking the problem seriously and has been giving, at least, some more honest assessments of the problem.

In the past two days, the administration seems be getting a little more coherent with reality.  Hopefully, they can keep it together long enough so that we feel less panicked, and normality sets in again.  That said, I think it is only a matter of time before they start the lie machine again and blaming everyone else.  They won't address any of the underlying issues.  I mean, why fund the CDC when you need to pay for a wall?",1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0

In early December, Britta Jewell, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis, Imperial College London, began researching some of the novel respiratory viruses that were then circulating.

Before long, she and her father, Nick Jewell — also an infectious disease epidemiological statistician, at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine — were in constant conversation about Covid-19. He was in bed, recovering from something like a severe flu. (He had tested flu-negative, which was unusual — and what motivated her research.) They talked over email and WhatsApp and the phone about the grim situation evolving in Wuhan, China, where the virus originated.

“In mid- to late January we started developing a plan for our family in case one of us became infected, and preparing supplies for two weeks of isolation,” she said. They also started calculating the numbers and sharing frustrations over their inability to convey to people the seriousness of the coronavirus’s exponential spread.

“We were listening to people, such as President Trump, saying, ‘What’s the fuss, it’s just like the flu,’ and ‘There are only 15 cases, and only one death in the U.S., much fewer than everywhere else, we’re doing great,’” Dr. Nick Jewell said. “But every epidemiologist knew what was coming inexorably toward us.”

On Tuesday, they noticed a [tweet by Mike Baker](https://twitter.com/bymikebaker/status/1237588549362278400?s=12) of The New York Times, in which he noted the cumulative number of coronavirus cases in the U.S. by date:

Jan. 14 — 0

Jan. 21 — 1

Jan. 28 — 5

Feb. 4 — 11

Feb. 11 — 14

Feb. 18 — 25

Feb. 25 — 59

Mar. 3 — 125

Mar. 10 — 1,004

“That is exponential growth,” Dr. Nick Jewell said. (He noted that the latest increase was also likely a reflection of increased testing.)

“We started discussing what actions to take in the face of exponential growth,” he said. “Obviously, we need to slow the rate of growth ([flatten the curve](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/11/science/coronavirus-curve-mitigation-infection.html)) through government and individual responses — effectively based on increased testing and heightened social distancing. But in order to accomplish that, we first need to convince people to take this outbreak seriously, which is no small task. It’s as if humans can only think linearly. But for epidemic modelers, exponential growth is the very nature of the beast.”

Dr. Britta Jewell wondered whether the power of exponential growth could be turned to a collective advantage. “The answer was yes, but only if we intervene early,” she said. “That means now.”

The exponential effect was now on other minds as well. Yaneer Bar-Yam, a physicist and systems scientist and the founding president of the New England Complex Systems Institute, convened a YouTube chat with Nassim Nicholas Taleb, a probability flâneur and risk analyst, to discuss “[Why It’s Better to Panic Early](https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&amp;v=e2Kga5HeAqk),” following up on [a paper](https://necsi.edu/systemic-risk-of-pandemic-via-novel-pathogens-coronavirus-a-note) they put out in late January.

“The graph that really grabbed my attention was the one showing a model of daily new cases of Covid-19 with social-distancing measures starting just one day apart,” Dr. Britta Jewell said. “It only takes a one-day difference in action to see a 40 percent reduction in cases — that’s enormous. It really conveys the urgency of the situation.”",1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
295,"‘It’s Just Everywhere Already’: How Delays in Testing Set Back the U.S. Coronavirus Response
A series of missed chances by the federal government to ensure more widespread testing came during the early days of the outbreak, when containment would have been easier.
By Sheri Fink and Mike Baker

Updated 10:06 p.m. ET

A research project in Seattle tried to conduct early tests for the new coronavirus but ran into red tape before circumventing federal officials and confirming a case.Grant Hindsley for The New York Times
Dr. Helen Y. Chu, an infectious disease expert in Seattle, knew that the United States did not have much time.
In late January, the first confirmed American case of the coronavirus had landed in her area. Critical questions needed answers: Had the man infected anyone else? Was the deadly virus already lurking in other communities and spreading?
As luck would have it, Dr. Chu had a way to monitor the region. For months, as part of a research project into the flu, she and a team of researchers had been collecting nasal swabs from residents experiencing symptoms throughout the Puget Sound region.
To repurpose the tests for monitoring the coronavirus, they would need the support of state and federal officials. But nearly everywhere Dr. Chu turned, officials repeatedly rejected the idea, interviews and emails show, even as weeks crawled by and outbreaks emerged in countries outside of China, where the infection began.
By Feb. 25, Dr. Chu and her colleagues could not bear to wait any longer. They began performing coronavirus tests, without government approval.
What came back confirmed their worst fear. They quickly had a positive test from a local teenager with no recent travel history. The coronavirus had already established itself on American soil without anybody realizing it.
“It must have been here this entire time,” Dr. Chu recalled thinking with dread. “It’s just everywhere already.”
In fact, officials would later discover through testing, the virus had already contributed to the deaths of two people, and it would go on to kill 20 more in the Seattle region over the following days.
Federal and state officials said the flu study could not be repurposed because it did not have explicit permission from research subjects; the labs were also not certified for clinical work. While acknowledging the ethical questions, Dr. Chu and others argued there should be more flexibility in an emergency during which so many lives could be lost. On Monday night, state regulators told them to stop testing altogether.
The failure to tap into the flu study, detailed here for the first time, was just one in a series of missed chances by the federal government to ensure more widespread testing during the early days of the outbreak, when containment would have been easier. Instead, local officials across the country were left to work blindly as the crisis grew undetected and exponentially.
Even now, after weeks of mounting frustration toward federal agencies over flawed test kits and burdensome rules, states with growing cases such as New York and California are struggling to test widely for the coronavirus. The continued delays have made it impossible for officials to get a true picture of the scale of the growing outbreak, which has now spread to at least 36 states and Washington, D.C.
Dr. Robert R. Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in an interview on Friday that acting quickly was critical for combating an outbreak. “Time matters,” he said.
He insisted that despite the rocky start, there was still time to beat back the coronavirus in the United States. “It’s going to take rigorous, aggressive public health — what I like to say, block and tackle, block and tackle, block and tackle, block and tackle,” he said. “That means if you find a new case, you isolate it.”
But the Seattle Flu Study illustrates how existing regulations and red tape — sometimes designed to protect privacy and health — have impeded the rapid rollout of testing nationally, while other countries ramped up much earlier and faster. Faced with a public health emergency on a scale potentially not seen in a century, the United States has not responded nimbly.
The C.D.C.’s own effort to create a system for monitoring the virus around the country, using established government surveillance networks for the flu, has not yet built steam. And as late as last week, after expanding authorizations for commercial and academic institutions to make tests, administration officials provided conflicting accounts of when a significant increase in tests would be available.
In states like Maine, Missouri and Michigan, where there are few or no known infections, state public health officials say they have more than enough tests to meet demand.
But it remains unclear how many Americans have been tested for the coronavirus. The C.D.C. says approximately 8,500 specimens or nose swabs have been taken since the beginning of the outbreak — a figure that is almost certainly larger than the number of people tested since one person can have multiple swabs. By comparison, South Korea, which discovered its first case around the same time as the United States, has reported having the capacity to test roughly 10,000 people a day since late February.
A prime mission
As soon as the genetic sequence of the coronavirus was published in January, the C.D.C.’s first job was to develop a diagnostic test. “That’s our prime mission,” Dr. Redfield said, “to get eyes on this thing.”
The agency also released criteria for deciding which individuals should be tested for the virus — at first only those who had a fever and respiratory issues and had traveled from the outbreak’s origin in Wuhan, China.
The criteria were so strict that the sick man in the Seattle area who had visited Wuhan did not meet it. Still, worried state health officials pushed to get him checked, and the C.D.C. agreed. Local officials sent a sample to Atlanta and the results came back positive.
Officials monitored 70 people who were in contact with the man, including 50 who consented to getting nose swabs, and none tested positive for the coronavirus. But there was still the possibility that someone had been missed, said Dr. Scott Lindquist, the state epidemiologist for communicable diseases.
Around this time, the Washington State Department of Health began discussions with the Seattle Flu Study already going on in the state.
But there was a hitch: The flu project primarily used research laboratories, not clinical ones, and its coronavirus test was not approved by the Food and Drug Administration. And so the group was not certified to provide test results to anyone outside of their own investigators. They began discussions with state, C.D.C. and F.D.A. officials to figure out a solution, according to emails and interviews.
Dr. Scott F. Dowell, a former high-ranking C.D.C. official and a current deputy director at the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, which funds the Seattle Flu Study, asked for help from the leaders of the C.D.C.’s coronavirus response. “Hoping there is a solution,” he wrote on Feb. 10.
Later, Dr. Lindquist, the state epidemiologist in Washington, wrote an email to Dr. Alicia Fry, the chief of the C.D.C.’s epidemiology and prevention branch, requesting the study be used to test for the coronavirus.
C.D.C. officials repeatedly said it would not be possible. “If you want to use your test as a screening tool, you would have to check with F.D.A.,” Gayle Langley, an officer at the C.D.C.’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Disease, wrote back in an email on Feb. 16. But the F.D.A. could not offer the approval because the lab was not certified as a clinical laboratory under regulations established by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, a process that could take months.
Dr. Chu and Dr. Lindquist tried repeatedly to wrangle approval to use the Seattle Flu Study. The answers were always no.
“We felt like we were sitting, waiting for the pandemic to emerge,” Dr. Chu said. “We could help. We couldn’t do anything.”",1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0
296,"SHANGHAI — Recently, someone following the coronavirus crisis through China’s official news media would see lots of footage, often set to stirring music, praising the heroism and sacrifice of health workers marching off to stricken places.

But someone following the crisis through social media would see something else entirely: vitriolic comments and mocking memes about government officials, harrowing descriptions of untreated family members and images of hospital corridors loaded with patients, some of whom appear to be dead.

The contrast is almost never so stark in China. The government usually keeps a tight grip on what is said, seen and heard about it. But the sheer amount of criticism — and the often clever ways in which critics dodge censors, such as by referring to Xi Jinping, China’s top leader, as “Trump” or by comparing the outbreak to the Chernobyl catastrophe — have made it difficult for Beijing to control the message.

In recent days, critics have pounced when officials in the city of Wuhan, the center of the outbreak, wore their protective masks incorrectly. They have heaped scorn upon stumbling pronouncements. When Wuhan’s mayor spoke to official media on Monday, one commenter responded, “If the virus is fair, then please don’t spare this useless person.”

The condemnations stand as a rare direct challenge to the Communist Party, which brooks no dissent in the way it runs China. In some cases, Chinese leaders appear to be acknowledging people’s fear, anger and other all-too-human reactions to the crisis, showing how the party can move dramatically, if sometimes belatedly, to mollify the public.

Such criticism can go only so far, however. Some of China’s more commercially minded media outlets have covered the disease and the response thoroughly if not critically. But articles and comments about the virus continue to be deleted, and the government and internet platforms have issued fresh warnings against spreading what they call “rumors.”

“Chinese social media are full of anger, not because there was no censorship on this topic, but despite strong censorship,” said Xiao Qiang, a research scientist at the School of Information at the University of California, Berkeley, and the founder of China Digital Times, a website that monitors Chinese internet controls. “It is still possible that the censorship will suddenly increase again, as part of an effort to control the narrative.”

When China’s leaders battled the SARS virus in the early 2000s, social media was only just beginning to blossom in the country. The government covered up the disease’s spread, and it was left to journalists and other critics to shame the authorities into acknowledging the scale of the problem.

Today, smartphones and social media make it harder for mass public health crises to stay buried. But internet platforms in China are just as easily polluted with false and fast-moving information as they are everywhere else. During outbreaks of disease, Beijing’s leaders have legitimate reason to be on alert for quack remedies and scaremongering fabrications, which can cause panic and do damage.

In recent days, though, Beijing seems to be reasserting its primacy over information in ways that go beyond mere rumor control. At a meeting this past weekend between Mr. Xi and other senior leaders, one of the measures they resolved to take against the virus was to “strengthen the guidance of public opinion.”

Wang Huning, the head of the Communist Party’s publicity department and an influential party ideologue, was also recently named deputy head of the team in charge of containing the outbreak, behind only China’s premier, Li Keqiang.

Chinese officials seem to recognize that social media can be a useful tool for feeling out public opinion in times of crisis. WeChat, the popular Chinese messaging platform, said over the weekend that it would crack down hard on rumors about the virus. But it also created a tool for users to report tips and information about the disease and the response.

Internet backlash may already have caused one local government in China to change course on its virus-fighting policies. The southern city of Shantou announced on Sunday that it was stopping cars, ships and people from entering the city, in a policy that echoed ones in Wuhan. But then word went around that the decision had led people to panic-buy food, and by the afternoon, the order had been rescinded.

Nowhere has the local government been the target of more internet vitriol than in Hubei Province, where Wuhan is the capital.

After the Hubei governor, Wang Xiaodong, and other officials there gave a news briefing on Sunday, web users mocked Mr. Wang for misstating, twice, the number of face masks that the province could produce. They circulated a photo from the briefing of him and two other officials, pointing out that one of them did not cover his nose with his mask, that another wore his mask upside down and that Mr. Wang did not wear a mask at all.

On Monday, social media users were similarly unrelenting toward Wuhan’s mayor, Zhou Xianwang.During an interview Mr. Zhou gave to state television, commenters in live streams unloaded on him, with one writing: “Stop talking. We just want to know when you will resign.”Top authorities may be deliberately directing public anger toward officials in Hubei and Wuhan as a prelude to their resigning and being replaced. Many other targets within the Chinese leadership seem to remain off limits.This month, as news of the coronavirus emerged but Mr. Xi did not make public appearances to address it, people on the social platform Weibo began venting their frustration in veiled ways, asking, “Where’s that person?”

But even those comments were deleted. So some users started replacing Mr. Xi’s name with “Trump.” As in, “I don’t want to go through another minute of this year, my heart is filled with pain, I hope Trump dies.”

Other people hungering to express frustration have taken to the Chinese social platform Douban, which has been flooded recently by user reviews for “Chernobyl,” the hit television series about the Soviet nuclear disaster.

“In any era, any country, it’s the same. Cover everything up,” one reviewer wrote on Monday.

“That’s socialism,” wrote another.

Some Chinese news outlets have been able to report incisively on the coronavirus. The influential newsmagazine Caixin has put out rigorous reporting and analysis. The Paper, a digital news outlet that is overseen by Shanghai’s Communist Party Committee, published a chilling video about a Wuhan resident who couldn’t find a hospital that would treat him and ended up wandering the streets.

Mr. Xiao, the Chinese internet expert, said the central authorities long gave such outlets special leeway to cover certain topics in ways that official media cannot. But the outlets should not be viewed as independent of the government, he said, calling their coverage “planned and controlled publicity” from the authorities.

Even outside the digital realm, it is not hard to find people in China who remain unsure of whether to trust what their government is telling them about the outbreak.

Chen Pulin, a 78-year-old retiree, was waiting outside a Shanghai hospital recently while his daughter was inside being tested for the virus. When word of the disease first began trickling out, he immediately had doubts about whether officials were being forthcoming about it.

“Even now, the government seems to be thinking about the economy and social stability,” Mr. Chen said. “Those things are important, but when it comes to these infectious diseases, stopping the disease should come first.”

Feb 24: 229 cases  
Mar 10: 10,149 cases.  

Now look at each state with over 200 cases: NY WA and CA.

Fifteen days puts the us at over 30k cases in just these three states if we test and quarantine like Italy.

Let’s look at the states with over 50 cases: MA, CO, FL, TX, NJ, LA

Seventeen days puts the us another potential 60k cases in just these six states if we test and quarantine like Italy.

Let’s look at the states over 4 cases:
IL, GA, PA, VA, NE, OR, TN, MD, MI, WI, NV, NC, IA, IN, RI, MN, SC, OH, CT, KY, (DC), NM, AZ, SD, AR, NH, KS, UT

Obviously the math erodes the lower number states have, since cases could truly be contained, but we can’t know if it’s contained based on the level of testing. But this simple extrapolation should be a wake up call.

&gt; Food establishments in Johor Bahru are reporting a decline in sales of up to 70 per cent.

&gt; JOHOR BAHRU: Food eateries in Johor Bahru that usually see many customers from across the causeway are reeling from a sharp decline in sales, amid fears over the COVID-19 outbreak.

&gt; Restaurants and outlets interviewed by CNA said that the steep drop in business has been evident since Chinese New Year, when Johor reported its first confirmed case of the virus.

&gt; Among the affected businesses is Hiap Joo Bakery &amp; Biscuit Factory, known for its banana cakes. The bakery typically attracts a line of customers outside its doors near Jalan Dhoby.

&gt; Following the outbreak, sales has dipped by at least 50 per cent, said Mr Lim Toh Shin who runs the bakery’s operations.

&gt; “There is usually a long queue for our cakes at 11am every day, but these days, the line will only last for five minutes,” said Mr Lim.

&gt; “We now have excess cakes and are unable to sell all that we bake for the day,” he added.

&gt; ""VIRTUAL GHOST TOWN""

&gt; Mr Lim estimates that Singaporeans typically make up more than half of his total customer base, and the sharp decline recently can be attributed to fewer Singapore visitors.

&gt; “It’s clear because there are markedly fewer visitors on weekends, when most of our customers from Singapore usually come and buy,” he said.

&gt; Meanwhile along the same street, Mr Rahim Khan, operator of Salahuddin Bakery echoed similar sentiments.

&gt; Salahuddin Bakery sells freshly baked curry puffs and French loaves. Mr Khan said that business has slowed down by 40 to 50 per cent recently.

&gt; Salahuddin bakery along Jalan Dhoby, (Photo: Amir Yusof)

&gt; He attributed the fall in sales to people's fear that they might catch the virus if they travel.

&gt; “I can understand the fear. Some of my regular customers from Singapore called and apologised that they are unable to come, but I understand. It would not be worth the journey if they become sick,” he added.

&gt; Both bakeries are located near Jalan Dhoby in downtown Johor Bahru. The area is well known for its hipster cafes, traditional Chinese restaurants and classic bakeries. It is a hotspot for Singaporean visitors.

&gt; But recently, the place has become a “virtual ghost town” said Mr Khan.

&gt; Although the pedestrian walkkway near Jalan Dhoby has been recently expanded, the foot traffic is low because of the spread of the coronavirus. (Photo: Amir Yusof)

&gt; He added: “The virus is definitely to blame. But also, we are suffering now because there has been some construction work to widen pedestrian walkways. This makes it hard for our customers to park”.

&gt; There have been 22 cases of COVID-19 in Malaysia, with 17 people discharged so far.

&gt; LESS CAUSEWAY CONGESTION

&gt; According to media reports, there has been less congestion at the Causeway over the past few weeks.

&gt; On Thursday (Feb 20) evening, the journey from Woodlands Checkpoint to Johor Bahru via the Causeway took around 20 mins, based on what CNA experienced. This peak hour commute usually takes around one to three hours.

&gt; 

&gt; Screenshot from the ""Beat the Jam!"" app showing how travel duration across the Causeway from Singapore to Johor Bahru on Feb 20 is lower overall than the week before.

&gt; The “Beat the Jam!” app, which charts travel duration at the Causeway and Second Link throughout the day, has noted a sharp decrease in movement from Singapore to Johor Bahru, even on weekends.

&gt; Mr Mohd Taufik Mohd Jamal, a Johorean who travels to and fro Singapore for work six times a week, told CNA that the lack of congestion at the Causeway has been a “pleasant surprise”.

&gt; “In my 10 years of travelling back and forth, I’ve never experienced weeks like this where the travel times are less than half an hour,” said the 45-year-old who works in construction.

&gt; Despite that, he expressed hope that things will go back to normal.

&gt; “Many businesses in Johor, including the F&amp;B businesses, are suffering because of the virus. It’s not a healthy situation for Malaysians,” added Mr Mohd Taufik.

&gt; Over at Pandan Wholesale Market, a popular area for Singaporeans to do their groceries and have their meals, the footfall was very low.

&gt; The food courts at the market, popular for Indonesian, Thai and Pakistani cuisine, were empty during dinner time.

&gt; When a stray customer walked by, vendors would approach them and hurriedly hand out their menus.

&gt; Ms Dewi Rudyman, who operates an Indonesian stall, said revenue has dipped by 70 per cent since Chinese New Year.

&gt; “Pandan wholesale market is a bit narrow, and shoppers are forced to walk close to one another,” she said.

&gt; “I heard from my customers claiming it’s not safe to visit now because you never know if there will be a spread of the (coronavirus). So far, there has been no case reported from here though.”

&gt; NO MOOD FOR SEAFOOD

&gt; Seafood restaurants in Johor Bahru are also reporting slow sales.

&gt; A chain of Chinese seafood restaurants at Kampung Telok Jawa, which is popular among Singaporeans, have all seen fewer customers over the last three weeks.

&gt; 

&gt; Seafood restaurants in Johor Bahru - Todak, YX, TKK and Tepi Pantai - are all impacted by the coronavirus. (Photo: Amir Yusof)

&gt; A staff member from Todak Restaurant, who wanted to be known only as Mr Lim, told CNA that some regular customers from Singapore “have no mood” to eat a luxury seafood meal amid the spread of COVID-19.

&gt; 

&gt; “I think customers are scared of getting infected. Maybe the whole mood to sit down and enjoy is not the best right now,” he added.

&gt; The restaurant is popular for its fresh fish, butter squid and salted egg crab. Usually, customers have to wait in line before they are even seated. However, the outlet was only half full when CNA visited on Thursday evening.

&gt; The seats at Todak restaurant facing the Johor Straits were empty. (Photo: Amir Yusof)

&gt; Mr Wilson Tay, a Johorean customer at Todak Restaurant said he is enjoying the smaller crowd while it lasts.

&gt; “There’s no need to queue and it takes a shorter time to process orders. It’s not a bad time to visit,” he said.

302,"&gt; # Progress Singapore Party makes first public policy proposal since formation

&gt; SINGAPORE - The Progress Singapore Party (PSP) has announced some of its policy proposals, the first time it has done so since its formation last year.

&gt; The party, started and led by former People's Action Party stalwart Tan Cheng Bock, has held its cards close to its chest for both its policy platforms and areas it wants to contest in.

&gt; On Wednesday (Feb 12), it unveiled a slew of economic policy proposals ahead of Budget 2020, which will be delivered by Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance Heng Swee Keat on Feb 18.

&gt; Among the PSP proposals are a ""No to GST hike"" policy and that long-term infrastructure projects be funded not by taxpayer dollars.

&gt; ""In the immediate future, we advise against a further rise in the Goods &amp; Services Tax (GST) or any other fees, at least in the next five years,"" the party said in a statement.

&gt; ""Our strong financial standing should give us the courage to address with sustainable longer-term policies the mounting concerns of Singaporeans on issues such as rising cost of living, housing and healthcare costs; competition for jobs from non-Singaporeans; retirement inadequacy; as well as rising social inequality.""

&gt; It also said that long-term infrastructural projects, such as the Changi Airport Terminal 5, should be based on the private firms' own financial and commercial merit, and not require tax increases to fund them.

&gt; ""Of course, those projects with a large social benefit component should be given different consideration,"" it added.

&gt; The party also said it ""welcomes the Government's immediate short-term relief to assist Singaporeans and local companies"" in light of the ongoing novel coronavirus situation, but called for a more ""broad-based"" approach in helping not just the tourism sector, but the transport, retail and food and beverage industries.

&gt; Other policy proposals include ""more effective use"" of the national Budget surpluses and sovereign wealth funds, such as conducting a review of the Singapore education system.

&gt; The party also opposed short-term occasional handouts, in favour of more ""permanent plans"".

&gt; The PSP had revealed during its first walkabout in September last year that its policy team consists of more than 30 members and is headed by assistant treasurer Hazel Poa.

&gt; She had said back then the party's policies and manifesto will not address all of the issues that were raised at the party launch in August, such as voting age and ministerial salaries.

&gt; PSP assistant secretary-general Leong Mun Wai said: ""We are experiencing the strongest economic headwinds since the Global Financial Crisis and arguably a long overdue economic transformation, which combined makes Budget 2020 a very important one.""

&gt; The PSP's policy proposal announcement is the second one by an opposition political party recently, with the Singapore Democratic Party launching its 39-page climate change policy paper last Saturday.

303,"In case of paywall:

&gt;The surgeon general on Saturday urged the public to stop buying masks, warning that it won’t help against the spread of the coronavirus but will take away important resources from health care professionals.

&gt;“Seriously people — STOP BUYING MASKS!” the surgeon general, Jerome M. Adams, said in a tweet on Saturday morning. “They are NOT effective in preventing general public from catching #Coronavirus, but if health care providers can’t get them to care for sick patients, it puts them and our communities at risk!”

&gt;The plea comes as panicked consumers rush to buy masks online, including so-called N95s, a surge that has led to price gouging and counterfeit products.

&gt;In another tweet, Mr. Adams said the best way to protect against the virus is to wash hands regularly, and for those who are feeling ill to stay home.

&gt;Health officials around the world have been imploring the public to stop buying masks if they are healthy or not caring for someone who is ill. Medical professionals need a large supply of the masks because they are in direct contact with infected patients and must change their masks repeatedly.

&gt;“There are severe strains on protective equipment around the world,” said Dr. Michael J. Ryan, executive director of the health emergency program at the World Health Organization, during a briefing on Friday. “Our primary concern is to ensure that our front line health workers are protected and that they have the equipment they need to do their jobs.”

&gt;Dr. Ryan said masks primarily prevent a person from giving the disease to someone else.

&gt;“There are limits to how a mask can protect you from being infected,” he said. “The most important thing everyone can do is wash your hands, keep your hands away from your face and observe very precise hygiene.”

&gt;The W.H.O.’s guidelines recommend that health workers use surgical masks to cover their mouths and noses but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has instructed them to wear masks known as N95s, which are thicker, fit more tightly around the mouth and nose, and block out much smaller particles than surgical masks do.

&gt;Both masks help prevent the spread of droplets from a person’s cough or sneeze, but medical specialists have said that for average members of the public, they are generally not effective.

&gt;A person is more likely to get infected by touching contaminated surfaces than from a droplet traveling through the air.

&gt;Air can also get in around the edges of the masks, particularly flat surgical masks. Health care workers who wear N95 masks as part of their jobs are required to undergo a fit test at least once a year to ensure that there are no gaps around their mouths.

&gt;Most people are unlikely to know how to wear these masks and could accidentally contaminate themselves if they touch the outside of the mask when they remove it and then touch their face.

&gt;“Not having a mask does not necessarily put you at any increased risk of contracting this disease,” Dr. Ryan said.

&gt;But the message has not stopped people from buying the masks, particularly the N95s, which are usually inexpensive and popular with construction workers and painters.

&gt;“You know what a mask costs?” said Mike Bowen, the executive vice president of Prestige Ameritech, an N95 mask manufacturer in North Richland Hills, Texas. “Listen to this: A Class 2 medical device, you can buy two of them for the price of a gumball.”

&gt;He added: “They’re cheap. They’re automated. They’re not handmade.”

&gt;But on Amazon, sellers have been advertising masks for at least $10 each. One seller advertised 160 masks for $800, a deal that was no longer available as of Saturday.

&gt;Vice President Mike Pence seemed to address the shortage during a White House press briefing with President Trump on Saturday.

&gt;Mr. Pence, whom Mr. Trump appointed to coordinate the government’s response to the coronavirus outbreak, said the administration would have “40 million masks available today.”

&gt;The government has contracted with the multinational manufacturing giant 3M to produce 30 million more masks a month, Mr. Pence said.

&gt;Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Thursday that it was critical that masks remain available for doctors and nurses who were caring for those affected by the virus and for people tending to loved ones with the illness.

&gt;“There is no role for these masks in the community,” he said. “These masks need to be prioritized for health care professionals that as part of their job are taking care of individuals.”

&gt;Dr. Redfield’s comment came after an exchange with Representative Chrissy Houlahan, a Democrat of Pennsylvania, who asked how people should be preparing, including whether they needed to stock up on food or prescription medication.

&gt;“Not at this time,” he said.

&gt;“Should people be afraid?” Ms. Houlahan asked.

&gt;“No,” he replied.

&gt;“Should you wear a mask if you’re healthy?” she asked.

&gt;“No,” Dr. Redfield said.",1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

305,"&gt; # Singapore forms Wuhan virus ministerial task force, imported case 'inevitable': Gan Kim Yong

&gt; SINGAPORE: Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said on Wednesday (Jan 22) that he will co-chair a multi-ministerial task force to deal with the ""eventuality"" of the Wuhan virus on Singapore's shores.

&gt; He will lead the committee with Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong.

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; ""It is inevitable that we will see an imported case sooner or later,"" said Mr Gan, adding that this is because of the evolving situation and the high volume of traffic in and out of Singapore.

&gt; He was speaking to reporters after an update from the Ministry of Health (MOH) on the Wuhan virus situation. Three more suspected cases have been identified in Singapore and are undergoing testing.

&gt; 

&gt; The task force will have its first meeting on Thursday, Mr Gan said. He added that that it is important for the Government to understand the situation because there's ""a lot"" of unknowns.

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; ""I think it's better for us to preempt some of these potential risks and do what we can to mitigate the risk,"" he said.

&gt; Measures introduced have to be proportional to the situation, but because the situation is evolving quickly, response has to be quick, he said.

&gt; ""I think having a task force set up already will allow us to mount a very quick response, depending on the development of situation,"" he said.

&gt; 

&gt; When asked whether the Government foresees the Wuhan virus to be as serious as the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) outbreak of the early 2000s, Mr Gan said that given that many features of the new coronavirus are unknown.

&gt; ""It is better for us to take precautions, and to ensure that we protect Singaporeans,"" he said.

&gt; 

&gt; Mr Wong, who also spoke to reporters, said that he will play a coordinating role among ministries like the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Education and Ministry of Manpower.

&gt; While the lead agency is MOH, the situation goes beyond one agency, and requires a whole-of-government and even whole-of-Singapore response, Mr Wong said, adding that the task force was set up in consultation with Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat.

&gt; ""I will be helping Minister Gan to coordinate the responses across different government agencies to ensure that we have an effective and strong response, and our assurance to Singaporeans is that we will spare no effort,"" he said.

&gt; 

&gt; In a press release on Wednesday, the Health Ministry advised travellers to avoid non-essential travel to Wuhan.

&gt; ""MOH reminded the public to continue to exercise caution and attention to personal hygiene when travelling to the rest of China,"" the release said.

&gt; 

&gt; Wuhan, the Chinese city at the centre of the SARS-like outbreak, has urged people to stay away as it strives to contain a disease that has spread across the country.

&gt; The death toll from the virus has reached nine while more than 400 people have now been infected in 13 provinces and municipalities in China.

&gt; The disease is spreading just as hundreds of millions of people are travelling in packed trains, planes and buses across China to gather with friends and family for the Chinese New Year holiday, which starts on Saturday.

&gt; 

&gt; In a Facebook post, Mr Wong urged Singaporeans to do their part by being socially responsible.

&gt; ""The Government will spare no effort to defend and protect Singapore and Singaporeans. We stand ready to marshall all our resources towards this end. But the most important defence is for us to be psychologically prepared,"" he said.

&gt; Across the world, the virus has spread to Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and the United States.

&gt; 

&gt; On Wednesday, Singapore began isolating all pneumonia patients who have been in China in recent weeks. Those with acute respiratory infection and have visited a hospital in China within 14 days before their symptoms surfaced will also be isolated.

&gt; Previously, only patients with fever and pneumonia and who have travelled to Wuhan have been subject to isolation.

306,"Yeah and as far as I know they still haven’t restricted travel from Daegu and Gyeongsangbuk as of now, March 4th, when the number of infected has surpassed 5300, the epidemic has spread to all South Korean provinces, a hospital in Seoul became a new cluster of 14 reported confirmed cases after importing a case from Daegu, while China is well on its way for recovery in part thanks to its strict travel restriction measures both inside the country and to other countries.

At the end of January, China placed a travel restriction on Chinese nationals in China from going on tours to other countries. On February 25th, the South Korean government accused the Vietnamese government of quarantining 20 Korean nationals from Daegu to Vietnam without prior notice in the middle of a pandemic, when the number of cases in South Korea was in the 800. The South Korean media subsequently labeling countries (with special focus on Vietnam) that have imposed travel restriction on travelers from South Korea “Koreaphobic” despite anyone with eyes can see that the epidemic was blowing up fast in South Korea, and the South Korea government still hadn’t restricted travel for its nationals within the country and to other countries. In comparison, despite China’s initially putting pressure on countries that had put a travel ban on travelers from China, China’s response and travel ban of its citizens to other countries, even if a bit late, was downright charitable.

To sum up part 1: The South Korean government’s lack of containment measures when things start to go off the rail made the epidemic uncontainable now, and the 4 alarm bells within 2 weeks didn’t work.

II. The preventative measures were poor:

South Korea were one of the few countries in the world to not ban travelers from China, not even quarantining and testing them.

According to Reuters: https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-southkorea-church/members-of-church-at-center-of-south-koreas-coronavirus-outbreak-visited-wuhan-kcdc-idUSKBN20O1D5

""SEOUL (Reuters) - Some members of a church at the center of South Korea’s coronavirus outbreak visited the Chinese city of Wuhan in January, where the disease is believed to have originated, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Sunday.

Most of the South Korean patients were traced to a branch of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus in the southeastern city of Daegu. The church had a presence in Wuhan.

Kwon Jun-wook, a KCDC official, confirmed for the first time that some members of the church visited Wuhan during a briefing. He said it was unclear how many went there and whether the trip played a role in the outbreak.""

Emphasis mine.

Patient 29, 30, and 31 were all community cases who got infected from someone else around the end of Jan and beginning of Feb. Assuming that they were only the second link in a chain and not somewhere further down, we can see that the people who infected them were infected by end of Jan at the latest estimation, when there was 17 000 infected cases in Hubei, the Chinese authorities hadn’t enacted lockdown on Hubei and prevented Chinese nationals from going to other countries on tours, and the South Korean government didn’t even enact quarantine on all travelers from China. Even if a member of Shincheonji travelling from Wuhan was the only patient 0, the only reason why they would managed to get in and spread the disease undetected in South Korea was because the South Korean government refused to enact proper preventative measures and waited for China to do it for them. And judging from the 4 different alarm bells within 2 weeks, either there wasn’t only 1 patient 0 or there was a super spreader patient 0 undetected. Further genetic testing of the viral strains within the infected population can determine exactly which scenario it was, but as of now, I haven’t come across such report.

To sum up part 2: The preventative measures to prevent the epidemic from entering the country were either lacking or done poorly, in line with the subsequent poor containment measures and failure to put out the epidemic quickly due to inherent structural problems.",0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
307,"10% is really high, but it isn't high enough to cause itself to blow out. I never said it wasn't high, just said that wasn't the reason it blew out. It's symptomatic and transmissible for 14 days on average prior to death anyways, but much every single case required hospitalization within a couple days and you couldn't transmit it before symptoms. R0 of 3, 14 transmissible days before death, and 10% fatality rate will spread easily if you don't isolate it. All the 10% did was make it serious enough we isolated every single case ASAP, meaning the average days transmissible before isolation per case was something like 2 in 2003, so we got the new cases per case underneath 1. That's all that matters for spread - is the average case creating more and less than 1 more case? Before public health measures were implemented, the R0 of 2003 SARS was about 3. It was spreading just fine with a 10% fatality rate. After public health measures were implemented, the R0 fell to 0.4.

COVID is transmissible asymptomatically and doesn't result in hospitalization in the majority of cases, meaning the average transmissible days in contact with the public closer to 10. That's a *much* bigger difference regarding *spread* of the virus than a 1% vs 3% vs 10% death rate. Each case is causing more than 1 more case right now and that happened too fast for us to get a handle on it. Even if the COVID death rate was 10%, it would still be spreading at an R0 above 1 with current behavior. (Maybe we would've taken isolation more seriously and changed behavior earlier, but that's a different discussion - nothing intrinsic to the virus itself would cause R0 to drop from 3 to below 1 by rising to a 10% death rate).

From a current stage in the pandemic perspective we need testing yes, but on an individual case basis, the reason SARS didn't explode is because it was very easy to contain, not because it was fatal enough that it petered out in community spread anyways.

&gt; ADE has been observed for coronaviruses. Several studies have shown that sera induced by SARS-CoV spike enhance viral entry into Fc-receptor-expressing cells. Further, one study demonstrated that unlike receptor-dependent viral entry, sera dependent SARS-CoV entry does not go through the endosome pathway.
&gt; Additionally, it has long been known that **immunization of cats with feline coronavirus spike leads to worsened future infection due to the induction of infection-enhancing antibodies**. However, detailed molecular mechanisms for ADE of coronavirus entry are still unknown.

What it might mean in practice:

&gt; 
&gt; It’s highly possible to get infected a second time,” one of the doctors, who declined to be identified, told the outlet.
&gt; 
&gt; The physician said that medication used to treat the virus can have negative side effects on patients’ heart tissue, making them more susceptible to cardiac arrest.
&gt; 
&gt; “A few people recovered from the first time by their own immune system, but the meds [sic] they use are damaging their heart tissue, and **when they get it the second time, the antibody doesn’t help but makes it worse**, and they die a sudden death from heart failure,” the doctor said.

310,"&gt;Kushner entered into a crisis management process that, despite the triumphant and self-congratulatory tone of public briefings, was as haphazard and helter-skelter as the chaotic early days of Trump’s presidency — turning into something of a family-and-friends pandemic response operation.

I always feel better when Uday and Qusay get involved.

&gt;Kushner rushed to help write Trump’s widely panned Oval Office address to the nation. His supermodel sister-in-law’s father, Kurt Kloss, an emergency room doctor, crowdsourced suggestions from his Facebook network to pass along to Kushner.

They've hollowed out the federal government so badly this is what we're left with.

&gt;The scramble for solutions is occurring in an overriding atmosphere of trepidation of saying something that Trump might perceive as disloyal and of fear that their fumbles could cost the president his reelection in November.

&gt;“The problem is no one is sure who is in charge,” a senior administration official said. “Unless someone comes to you and says, ‘I was with the president five minutes ago,’ and you know they’re telling the truth, getting irreversible direction is a little difficult.”

Trump's reign of terror ""management"" style in action.

&gt;Graham said that after speaking Friday night with Trump and Kushner, as well as first lady Melania Trump, the president had gotten past some of his frustrations with news coverage of the coronavirus and was “all in” on developing mitigation plans. 

Good news! The president promises, for real this time, that he'll no longer sabotage the nation's response to the pandemic! What a victory.

&gt; Each day — including some weekends — Pence convenes an afternoon meeting of roughly 20 officials in the White House Situation Room, and about 10 more in an overflow room.

&gt;The task force meetings often last about 2 ½ hours. At best, they have been forums to suggest and debate a broad range of ideas, from disease mitigation to public communications. At worst, they have been dens of discord, with officials with varying portfolios feuding over policy or even simply power and position. The mood has turned especially tense over frustrations with testing delays.

&gt;Few decisions are made in these meetings, however. Trump has only occasionally attended, usually when Pence requests his time. Neither Kushner nor his wife, Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter and also a senior White House adviser, has attended — though Kushner’s focus is now on the coronavirus and he has assembled many of his allies in the government to assist.

If The Family isn't there, nothing gets done. 

&gt;Trump is between chiefs of staff — acting chief Mick Mulvaney is transitioning out while Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) prepares to replace him — and the lack of a forceful gatekeeper has led to the president conducting decision-making as he prefers: With upward of a half-dozen aides and advisers in the Oval Office, all scrambling to perform for him as they await his decisions, which sometimes depend on his mood.

Jesters performing to the mad king's delight or anger. 

This is your government in action. Note the complete lack of adult agency, the dearth of expertise and preparation. Just chaos, government by nepotism, and fear of enraging a lunatic.

&gt;Although Trump is the final decision-maker, as his aides are quick to remind people, a number of principals — including Pence, Kushner, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow, Domestic Policy Council Director Joe Grogan and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield — operate as power centers with their own fiefdoms. They compete with one another over ideas, often developed by their own staffs, and at times move to undercut rivals in meetings.

More than half of those (Pence, Kushner, Kudlow, Azar) are completely incompetent and/or do not believe in reality-based science. I don't know about the other two.

&gt;Senior officials and members of the task force also said they have to spend significant chunks of their day dealing with leaks, especially as officials try to escape blame for the testing issues that have plagued the administration’s response for weeks.

&gt;Among those seeking to avoid such blame is the president himself. Asked at Friday’s news conference whether he accepts responsibility for the continued shortage of test kits, Trump said, “No, I don’t take responsibility at all.”

Now they are showing symptoms and we have 100 people going and doing the same thing and in 5 more days i.e. In 10 days from beginning of carnival /parade we have 1000 people who again are going around and infecting people.

Josh Ostroff had a difficult choice to make: Cancel a trip to Japan in March that he’d been promising his 10-year-old son for three years, or ignore travel warnings and put his family’s health at risk amid the coronavirus outbreak.

He decided to cancel the trip.

When the Toronto-based family asked for their money back, citing the Canadian government’s warning to “exercise a high degree of caution” in Japan, they received a refund from their hotels and a voucher from the airline. Airbnb Inc. said no.

The San Francisco-based startup said the family didn’t qualify for a refund under its new “extenuating circumstances” coronavirus policy, which only applies to China, Italy and South Korea. The home-share company’s official response to the family refers to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: “If the CDC’s precautions are followed, you could safely travel to Japan.”

Ostroff was shocked. “I repeatedly asked about bringing a child into this situation and they did not answer,” he said. “I feel like Airbnb is being recklessly irresponsible here.”

Airbnb, which was founded in 2008 during the financial crisis as a cheaper alternative to hotels, is confronting a second major challenge in the coronavirus. The stakes are higher than ever this time around because this is the year Airbnb wants to debut on the stock market. And with more than 7 million listings across the globe and a private market valuation of $31 billion, Airbnb’s reputation has never mattered more or been under more scrutiny.

The Covid-19 virus, which is now active in more than 100 countries, has hit the travel industry hard. Some airlines have canceled flights to certain countries, hotels have closed and the some of the biggest conferences of the year have been scrapped. Many companies have forbidden international travel and told staff to work from home. On Monday, Booking Holdings Inc., the world’s largest online travel-booking site, withdrew its already bleak first-quarter guidance, citing the worsening impact of the coronavirus.

Navigating the global outbreak is trickier for Airbnb than for big hotel chains or airlines who serve only travelers and manage all of their inventory. Airbnb is a two-way platform, connecting people who want to rent out all or part of their home with travelers seeking accommodations. For every guest cancellation the company approves there is a host at the other end who winds up out of pocket.

In its drive to balance the needs of hosts, who sometimes get their entire income from listing property on the site, against travelers’ concerns, Airbnb -- at least for now -- is putting the onus on hosts to be accommodating, such as by offering refunds or loosening cancellation policies. But that’s leaving a lot of travelers disgruntled and feeling like they’re footing the bill for stays they had no choice but to cancel.

Smart companies strive to protect their reputations, especially when bad things happen outside their control, said Micah Solomon, a customer service expert and author of the book Ignore Your Customers And They’ll Go Away. “This crisis is going to be over sometime,” he said, and when it’s over “you still want to be the go-to place for guests.”

Right now not many guests want to be at an Airbnb. Angry travelers have flooded Twitter with complaints over what many are calling a lack of compassion during a global health emergency. Users have vented about four-day waits to speak to a real person and said the company’s policies are implicitly encouraging them to put their health at risk. One user wrote: “Looks like we have to actually get covid-19 to get a 100% refund from @Airbnb. Talk about mixed incentives.” Another said: “No corporate social responsibility? You’re forcing people to take their trips and possibly spread COVID.”

Part of the problem stems from Airbnb’s shared responsibility with hosts on refunds. Airbnb will give a full refund within the first 48 hours after a guest books a site. After that, it’s up to hosts to set how much of a refund they’re willing to offer. These policies, outlined on each individual listing, can range from very flexible, offering free cancellation up to a day before, to very strict no refund whatsoever. Airbnb says hosts offer flexible and moderate cancellation policies on more than 60% of current listings.

In Ostroff’s case, he had booked three Airbnb’s for the trip to Japan and got three very different responses to his refund requests. The first host granted a full refund, but Airbnb still pocketed a $125 service fee from the reservation. The second host refused any refund and the third simply never replied. In all, the family lost more than $1,000.

After being made aware of the Ostroff’s situation by Bloomberg, Airbnb offered the family a full refund.

Airbnb said not all of its guests are angry. “We have heard from many guests who appreciate that their hosts have been flexible and helped them rearrange or cancel their travel plans with no penalty,” it said in a statement.

Many U.S. companies are basing their policies on guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the national public health institute. The CDC rates Japan an alert level 2, and recommends older adults and those with chronic medical conditions consider postponing nonessential travel there. But the country is taking more drastic action. Schools, museums and sporting events have been canceled, and the Hokkaido region has declared a state of emergency. The government is advising against being in crowds.

Travel companies have varying responses to requests for refunds. Expedia Group Inc.’s vacation-rental site VRBO hasn’t extended its cancellation or refund policy for guests impacted by the virus. The company’s Book with Confidence Guarantee only protects guests from fraudulent listings and misrepresentation. “It does not cover cancellations due to travel advisories from force majeure,” meaning unforeseeable circumstances beyond its control, Expedia said in a statement. Marriott International Inc. is waiving cancellation fees for stays through March 31 for travel to or from several countries in Asia and Italy.

On Tuesday, Airbnb updated its policies to offer hosts more tools to grant refunds and, in turn, allow guests to postpone travel plans. It will reward hosts who are willing to be flexible on refunds by giving their listings more visibility and scrapping the 3% fee it typically charges. The company also offered to return its service fee to guests as a coupon to be used on future bookings if trips have to be canceled due to coronavirus.

“Travel on Airbnb is powered by people, not large corporations,” Airbnb’s head of homes Greg Greeley said in a statement. Because of Airbnb’s “two-sided model, when a crisis like Covid-19 hits, we know that it doesn’t just impact us as a company, but also the individual stakeholders within our community: the hosts who rely on their Airbnb income, and guests who have their travel plans disrupted.” Airbnb is “committed to doing everything we can to fairly support both parties, consistent with how this two-sided marketplace works,” he added.

While gearing up for its public listing, Airbnb has been spending more on marketing and new safety features, causing the company to swing to a loss in 2019 after two years of profit before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. “It’s easy to understand why they’re being very prudent with refunds,” said Bradley Tusk, a venture capitalist who advises technology companies in crisis, though has never worked with Airbnb. But, warned that the company risked hurting its brand as it edges closer to a listing. (Tusk also ran the 2009 mayoral campaign of Michael Bloomberg, the owner of Bloomberg LP.)

Airbnb’s updated policy does little for travelers like the Ostroff’s, and others who have had to cancel or postpone trips to the 97 or so countries not covered by the company’s extenuating circumstances policy. Nor does it help those who were planning to attend public events that have since been scrapped.

William Matchin was traveling from South Carolina to Massachusetts for two psychology conferences this month. Both were canceled due to the virus and Airbnb declined to give him a refund. “It took forever to get on the phone with them and basically they just said go and talk to the host and try to get a refund from them,” Matchin said. “This is such a stark contrast to hotels and airlines which have issued automatic refunds no questions asked. It’s crazy.”",1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0

&gt; Wuhan man: I’m going to take dad to eat bak kut teh

&gt; When Mr Wang, a tourist from China, was admitted to hospital on Jan 24, he only had a slight cough, but felt well otherwise.

&gt; Over the next few weeks, the cough persisted, but the 37-year-old Chinese national did not have any other symptoms such as a runny nose or fever.

&gt; Tests had shown, however, that he was infected with the coronavirus despite the mild symptoms.

&gt; “It was quite similar to having a cold, and for my case, it felt less severe than a cold,” the Wuhan native said in an interview in Mandarin with the media yesterday.

&gt; “When I have a cold, I sometimes get a more serious cough or runny nose, but I didn’t have these symptoms this time. Maybe I am lucky in this respect.”

&gt; Mr Wang, who did not want to reveal his full name, still had to be hospitalised at the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) for four weeks as tests throughout that time found he was still infected.

&gt; He was finally discharged yesterday, after two consecutive tests found him to be clear of the virus.

&gt; His 66-year-old father, the first coronavirus patient in Singapore, was discharged a day earlier, having also stayed in hospital for a period of 28 days.

&gt; The pair, along with Mr Wang’s children and a few other family members, had flown to Singapore for a 10-day holiday on Jan 20. The holiday was disrupted after Mr Wang’s father developed a fever on the family’s second day here.

&gt; The father’s fever fell and rose again, and he felt cold and warm intermittently. Mr Wang took him to SGH, which confirmed the infection. Mr Wang was also found to be infected on Jan 24, making him the third coronavirus patient here.

&gt; “I wasn’t very worried as I saw from the news that the disease was more severe for those who are elderly and who have underlying symptoms, but I was worried about my dad, who is older,” said Mr Wang.

&gt; “He had pneumonia, so he had to use a respirator for the first few days to get more oxygen into his blood. He felt a bit unwell, but the doctor told us that his condition was stable, so we felt more assured.”

&gt; Mr Wang’s father told The Straits Times that he felt unwell for about three days. “It wasn’t too unbearable, and I was less worried after my condition stabilised,” he said.

&gt; He passed his time by making phone calls to his son and family members. “I also started practising a bit of martial arts in the isolation room. I have practised for more than 10 days,” he said with a laugh.

&gt; “I made sure to complete all my meals too, as I wanted to stay optimistic and defeat the virus.”

&gt; The younger Mr Wang passed his time by reading books, watching TV shows and calling his family members.

&gt; While both father and son had to spend quite some time in hospital, they said they were well taken care of. The nurses helped to get them dumplings on Chinese New Year’s Eve to help them fulfil a Chinese tradition signifying the changing of years, and also gave them treats such as home-made soup.

&gt; Now that they have recovered, they will spend a few days recuperating here before heading back to Wuhan.

&gt; Mr Wang said: “I had bak kut teh before, and I liked it. I want to take my dad to try the dish; it will be a nice ending to our time here.”

Two weeks ago I shared my U.S. coronavirus tracker and was met with tremendous support 🙏 [https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/ffhcol/i\_made\_a\_dedicated\_us\_coronavirus\_tracker\_that/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/ffhcol/i_made_a_dedicated_us_coronavirus_tracker_that/). Thank you everyone for the feedback. What started off as a weekend project became something I spend most of my waking hours working on while juggling a full-time job. 

I read all your comments and emails but can't respond to them all due to the sheer volume, so I wanted to take the time to share some things I've worked on so far:

* Added 'Cases by County' table that shows updated stats for every affected county/state
* Autodetects what county and state you are in and shows that first in the table
* Added geographical county boundaries on the map to delineate infection zones instead of using arbitrary circles. Boundaries were sourced from the 2018 U.S. Census.
* If it detects you are not in an infection zone, it calculates the closest infected county from you and displays it on the map, including how far away it is and how many cases/deaths the area has.
* As more and more counties are added to the map, it may take more time to calculate this. I'm planning to switch to a faster algorithm soon so this won't be a problem.
* Minified data payloads to improve site load times
* Added a running 24-hour change for nationwide number of cases/deaths/recovered.
* Added log scale option so we can better visualize the cases/deaths on the same chart &amp; analyze the trend of growth.
* Added map legend with 6 colors and ranges. The vast majority of counties are still in the 1-5 cases range so the granularity of the legend is biased toward the lower case counts.
* Started archiving hourly snapshots of county-level data so we can see the change over time in our counties, and this opens up the door for cool animations/visualizations. Many of you wanted a date slider to ""go back in time"" to see how the virus spread visually on the map (cool idea!).
* A bunch of manual fixes to correct geographical quirks
* Added fullscreen map button

&amp;#x200B;

Coming soon:

* 24hr, 7day change for every county - I think this would be very useful to track the trend in our backyards
* \# new cases per day added to chart
* More detailed county-level stats - death rate, population, etc.
* Account for county population and show cases per capita (e.g. 4 in 10,000 ppl in your county is infected)
* National and state-level testing data - # of positive/negative/pending cases.
* Add more colors to the legend to account for counties with much more cases than before (NY!!).
* Recognize independent cities as separate from their surrounding counties (mainly in Virginia, Maryland, Missouri)
* More graphs to visualize the data - growth rate, predictions based off past 5-day curve, etc
* Add field to enter zip code / county name and fly to that location on the map
* Improve map/site load performance

318,"In my opinion, the apparent reason that Trump wasn’t proactively doing anything about the then-coming &amp; -arriving Coronavirus, ignored medical-intelligence briefings predicting the pandemic, and claimed it would “miraculously disappear by April” is because he’d been delusionally brainwashed by his sycophantic Dominionist followers to wan to disingenuously believe as much.

Dominionists rule the roost of Trump’s political base and have been saying that the Coronavirus pandemic will “miraculously disappear by Easter.” They also hail Trump as a “modern-day King David” and “the vessel through whom God speaks”.

July 2019, a group of Chinese virologists were removed from the lab and the University of Manitoba, including Dr. Xiangguo Qiu, her husband Dr. Keding Cheng and students they brought from china with connections to labs in Wuhan.

The couple is under investigation in relation to an ""improper package"" that reportedly prompted a security breach.

When the shipment from Canada was uncovered, security access was revoked for Qiu, her husband, and the Chinese students. IT specialists entered Qiu’s office after hours to gain access to her computer, and her regular trips to China were halted.

&gt;[https://besacenter.org/perspectives-papers/china-biological-warfare/](https://besacenter.org/perspectives-papers/china-biological-warfare/)

Qiu reportedly made at least five trips over the academic year 2017-18 alone to the Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Chinese students from a notable range of Chinese scientific facilities have joined Qiu at the NML over the past decade.

Of those facilities, four are believed to be involved in Chinese biological weapons development. They are:

* Institute of Military Veterinary, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Changchun
* Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Chengdu Military Region
* Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hubei
* Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing

The Wuhan National Biosaftey Laboratory reportedly houses the Chinese Military's Virology department and presumably, the government's bioweapons program.

Lt. Col. (res.) Dr. Dany Shoham published a paper on the incident:

I have the coronavirus. And it hasn’t been that bad.
I am in my late 60s, and the sickest I’ve ever been was when I had bronchitis several years ago. That laid me out on my back for a few days. This has been much easier: no chills, no body aches. I breathe easily, and I don’t have a stuffy nose. My chest feels tight, and I have coughing spells. If I were at home with similar symptoms, I probably would have gone to work as usual.
I caught the virus on the Diamond Princess, the cruise ship that was quarantined outside Yokohama for 14 days, at the end of a 16-day cruise I took with my wife, Jeri. When I left the ship a couple of weeks ago, I felt fine. We checked our temperatures throughout our quarantine. Jeri and I got a swab test for the virus. Our temperatures were normal; they’d get the swab results back in 48 hours. Our test results had not arrived before we boarded buses for the airport, where two U.S. government planes waited for us.
As we took off from Tokyo, I had a bit of a cough, but I chalked it up to the dry air in the cabin. I felt pretty tired — but who wouldn’t, in our situation? I dozed off.
When I woke up, I had a fever. I made my way to the back of the cargo plane, where the Air Force had set up a quarantine area cordoned off with sheets of plastic. They took my temperature. It was over 103 degrees. So I took a seat in the quarantine area and fell back asleep until we touched down in California, at Travis Air Force Base.Officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention came onto the plane and said that three of us who had been cordoned off would fly to Omaha (with our spouses, if they wanted to come along). The CDC had a quarantine location at the University of Nebraska’s hospital. We arrived on Feb. 17, greeted by a fleet of ambulances and police cars. Officials put me on a stretcher and wheeled me into a van, which made for a very dramatic scene. I easily could have walked myself, despite my exhaustion.On the hospital campus, they put me in a biocontainment unit. The space was sealed off, with two double-paned windows that looked out on the hallway, and a large, heavy, insulated door. Two cameras watched me at all times; a set of computer monitors were equipped with microphones, so that the medical staff and I could communicate with CDC officials at central command down the hall. The room had last been used for the Ebola outbreak in 2014.While there is no vaccine for coronavirus, preventive steps and awareness are the best tools to prepare and protect yourself in the event of an outbreak.  A doctor and nurses reviewed my case with me and took a bunch of lab tests. They wore heavy-duty hazmat suits sealed with duct tape and equipped with motors that helped with air circulation. It looked like something out of “The Andromeda Strain.” When the test came back a few hours later, I wasn’t surprised to learn that I had the coronavirus. Later, the Tokyo swab confirmed the result — I had caught the virus even before I left the ship.
It didn’t scare me too badly. I knew my number was up. The way I saw it, I was going to get stuck in at least 14 more days of quarantine, even if I didn’t get the virus. So many fellow passengers had come down with the illness, including one of my friends, that I’d gotten somewhat used to the idea that I might catch it, too. My wife, however, tested negative and headed to quarantine at a separate facility a few blocks away. After those days being cooped up on the ship together, I think we both relished the alone time; we still could communicate through our phones.
During the first few days, the hospital staff hooked me up to an IV, mostly as a precaution, and used it to administer magnesium and potassium, just to make sure I had plenty of vitamins. Other than that, my treatment has consisted of what felt like gallons and gallons of Gatorade — and, when my fever rose just above 100 degrees, some ibuprofen. The nurses came to the room every four hours or so, to check my vitals, ask if I needed anything and to draw my blood. I got very good at unhooking all the monitors checking my oxygen level, blood pressure and heart rate so I could go to the bathroom or just pace around the room a little, to get my blood flowing. I never quite got the hang of hooking them back up without making a tangled mess. After 10 days, I moved out of biocontainment and into the same facility as Jeri. Now we can videochat from our separate quarantines, in neighboring rooms.As of my most recent test, on Thursday, I am still testing positive for the virus. But by now, I don’t require much medical care. The nurses check my temperature twice a day and draw my blood, because I’ve agreed to participate in a clinical study to try to find a treatment for coronavirus. If I test negative three days in a row, then I get to leave.
The time has passed more quickly than I would’ve expected. With my laptop, I get as much work done as I can, remotely. I catch up with friends. I take walks around my room, trying to take a thousand more steps each day. I also watch the news. It’s surreal to see everyone panic — news conferences, the stock market falling, school closures — about a disease I have. It does seem likely that coronavirus will spread in the United States, but it won’t help anybody if we all panic. It’s true that the disease seems much more likely to be fatal for older people and those in poor health. I’m relatively fortunate: I’m still younger than the most at-risk groups, and I’m in good shape, giving me less cause for alarm. Others who contract the virus won’t be as lucky. At least six Diamond Princess passengers have died from the disease, of around 705 passengers who caught it.Still, coronavirus doesn’t have to be a horrible calamity. Based on my experience, I’d recommend that everyone get a good digital thermometer, just as a comfort tool, so they can reassure themselves if their noses start running.
If you told me when I left home in January that I wouldn’t be back until March — that, instead, I would be confined for more than 24 days because I’d catch a novel virus at the center of what could become a pandemic — that would have completely freaked me out. But now that it’s happening, I’m just taking it one day at a time.As told to Post editor Sophia Nguyen.",0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0
321,"Another big reason for why it's imperative to support Bernie is the *necessity* to defeat a President who is supporting the caging of kids and separation of families and making life for all of us more dangerous by actually suprressing information on the COVID-19 virus while his *own* medical advisors have to constantly contradict what he is saying.

And in order to defeat the immense rabid fanboying from Trump's base, we need a nominee with a movement at his back who will actually go out and advocate for what is needed rather than just sitting in nicely decorated rooms and signing checks in the hopes of it happeneing.

Donating hard earned money and depriving yourself of free time to volunteer for a campaign requires that you are motivated to do so. Even the most well-meaning person will not last long trying to support a campaign that they don't really believe in. They would still vote against Trump, but the difference that volunteering can make in terms of convincing other people around you to also support your candidate is huge. There is only one candidate where I see this level of motivation being sustained in a way that will really, truly make a difference. And that difference will absolutely affect downballot races as well.

There is also a time for moderation and a time for courage, so I want to share with you a passage from a famous letter written by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr about the concept of being a moderate:

&gt; First, I must confess that over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to ""order"" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: ""I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action""; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a ""more convenient season."" Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.

The full essay/letter here: https://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles_Gen/Letter_Birmingham.html

I also want to share with you a passage from Barack Obama's book ""Audacity of Hope"" that highlights the corrupting influence of money and campaign finance fundraisers from wealthy donors on personal principles:

&gt; I can’t assume that the money chase didn’t alter me in some ways. …

&gt; Increasingly I found myself spending time with people of means — law firm partners and investment bankers, hedge fund managers and venture capitalists. As a rule, they were smart, interesting people, knowledgeable about public policy, liberal in their politics, expecting nothing more than a hearing of their opinions in exchange for their checks. But they reflected, almost uniformly, the perspectives of their class: the top 1 percent or so of the income scale that can afford to write a $2,000 check to a political candidate. They believed in the free market and an educational meritocracy; they found it hard to imagine that there might be any social ill that could not be cured by a high SAT score. They had no patience with protectionism, found unions troublesome, and were not particularly sympathetic to those whose lives were upended by the movements of global capital. Most were adamantly prochoice and antigun and were vaguely suspicious of deep religious sentiment.

&gt; And although my own worldview and theirs corresponded in many ways — I had gone to the same schools, after all, had read the same books, and worried about my kids in many of the same ways — I found myself avoiding certain topics during conversations with them, papering over possible differences, anticipating their expectations. On core issues I was candid; I had no problem telling well-heeled supporters that the tax cuts they’d received from George Bush should be reversed. Whenever I could, I would try to share with them some of the perspectives I was hearing from other portions of the electorate: the legitimate role of faith in politics, say, or the deep cultural meaning of guns in rural parts of the state.

&gt; Still, I know that as a consequence of my fund-raising I became more like the wealthy donors I met, in the very particular sense that I spent more and more of my time above the fray, outside the world of immediate hunger, disappointment, fear, irrationality, and frequent hardship of the other 99 percent of the population — that is, the people that I’d entered public life to serve. And in one fashion or another, I suspect this is true for every senator: The longer you are a senator, the narrower the scope of your interactions. You may fight it, with town hall meetings and listening tours and stops by the old neighborhood. But your schedule dictates that you move in a different orbit from most of the people you represent.

&gt; And perhaps as the next race approaches, a voice within tells you that you don’t want to have to go through all the misery of raising all that money in small increments all over again. You realize that you no longer have the cachet you did as the upstart, the fresh face; you haven’t changed Washington, and you’ve made a lot of people unhappy with difficult votes. The path of least resistance — of fund-raisers organized by the special interests, the corporate PACs, and the top lobbying shops — starts to look awfully tempting, and if the opinions of these insiders don’t quite jibe with those you once held, you learn to rationalize the changes as a matter of realism, of compromise, of learning the ropes. The problems of ordinary people, the voices of the Rust Belt town or the dwindling heartland, become a distant echo rather than a palpable reality, abstractions to be managed rather than battles to be fought.",1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0
322,"&gt; # COVID-19: Singapore confirms 9 new cases, 6 linked to Grace Assembly of God church; total at 67

&gt; By Nicholas Yong and Koh Wanting

&gt; SINGAPORE — A senior Ministry of Health (MOH) official on Friday (14 February) confirmed nine new cases of the novel coronavirus – the highest in a single day here to date –, bringing the total number of cases here to 67.

&gt; More details of the patients would be shared in a press release later in the evening, said Associate Professor Kenneth Mak, MOH director of medical services, during a press conference led by a multi-ministry taskforce on the virus, also known as COVID-19.

&gt; He shared that six of the new cases are linked to Grace Assembly of God church, one of at least five such identified clusters of local transmissions here. The new addition means that 13 of 67 confirmed cases have been linked to the church.

&gt; The other four clusters are associated with health products shop Yong Thai Hang along Cavan Road, The Life Church and Missions Singapore in Paya Lebar, a business meeting at the Grand Hyatt hotel and a construction site at Seletar Aerospace Heights.

&gt; Prof Mak also said that two patients have fully recovered and have discharged, bringing the total number of recovered cases to 17.

&gt; Six patients remain critically ill in the intensive care unit.

&gt; When asked if there was a “super spreader” in the Grace Assembly of God church, Prof Mak said that there was not enough information to arrive at that conclusion.

&gt; Health Minister Gan Kim Yong, co-chair of the taskforce, stressed the importance of being prepared even while there is ""currently no evidence"" of widespread community transmission in Singapore.

&gt; Additional measures will be taken as “the situation evolves”, he added, noting that researchers have warned that there could be “many more” infections in communities around the world.

&gt; “Locally, we do expect the number of confirmed cases to increase over time. This is also partly due to the enhanced disease surveillance, we have put in place,"" he added.

&gt; Co-chair National Development Minister Lawrence Wong said, ""A few days ago, Prime Minister Lee spoke about the scenario where the virus may become more widespread and we have to change our approach.""

&gt; He added, ""We are not there yet.""

&gt; Gan stressed that Singapore authorities have no plans to upgrade the Dorscon level from orange to red yet.

&gt; “Please help me stop the rumour. It’s already difficult enough stopping the spread of the virus...I want to say categorically: we have no plans to go to Dorscon Red,” he said.

&gt; The novel strain belongs to the same family of coronaviruses as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed nearly 800 people globally during a 2002-2003 outbreak and also started in China.

&gt; It likely originated from Wuhan’s Huanan Seafood Market, where live animals or products – such as foxes, wolf puppies, giant salamanders, snakes, porcupines, and camel meat – are sold.

&gt; Declared a global emergency by the World Health Organisation (WHO), COVID-19 has spread to 27 territories beyond mainland China. The WHO also said that cases being transmitted by people who have never travelled to China could be the ""tip of the iceberg"".

&gt; By territory, Singapore has the second-highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases after mainland China.

&gt; The global tally includes cruise ship Diamond Princess, moored off Japan, which has 218 cases. Five Singaporeans on board the ship have reported that they are physically well, said a Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson on Wednesday, in response to Yahoo News Singapore’s queries.

&gt; Almost 1,400 people have died of the virus in China, sickening over 64,000 people. The last two days saw a steep rise in the number of cases after a change in diagnostic methods in the country.

&gt; The National Health Commission disclosed a statistical error, saying it removed 108 deaths in Hubei that had been double-counted, but the nationwide toll still rose to 1,380 on Friday.

&gt; Three territories, Japan, Hong Kong, and the Philippines, have each reported the death of a patient infected with the virus.

&gt; Patients suffering from the new strain may exhibit fever and symptoms of lower respiratory illness – such as coughing or difficulty in breathing – as well as pneumonia-like symptoms like a runny nose, sore throat, and headache.

&gt; However, some who have died from it have not displayed symptoms of fever, according to details released by China’s National Health Commission, potentially complicating global efforts to check for infected travellers as they arrive at airports and other travel hubs.

323,"&gt; # COVID-19: Panic buying shows 'lack of trust' in government's crisis messaging, says Yaacob Ibrahim

&gt; SINGAPORE — The “irrational” panic buying of provisions in response to the raising of the country’s outbreak response level shows a “lack of trust” in the government telling Singaporeans what is the right thing to do especially during a crisis, said Jalan Besar GRC Member of Parliament Professor Yaacob Ibrahim on Wednesday (26 February).

&gt; “Rumours and misinformation about the lack of supplies help to fuel senseless hoarding. It shows a lack of trust; chaos could have broken out leading to unimaginable losses. This is something we all don't want to happen in Singapore,” said the former communications and information minister during his Budget 2020 debate speech in Parliament.

&gt; He noted that the rush to stock up supplies over the weekend following the 7 February announcement that the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (Dorson) level will be raised from yellow to orange due to the COVID-19 outbreak is a reminder that “getting communications right is very important”.

&gt; “During SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in 2003), there was no social media. Today, we are inundated by news of all sorts of various platforms, and from friends and strangers alike,” Prof Yaacob explained.

&gt; “The fundamental question is whether we trust the government in telling us what is the right thing to do, especially during a crisis.”

&gt; FairPrice Group CEO Seah Kian Peng spoke in Parliament earlier on the same day about the “shopping frenzy” during the period, saying the cooperative’s measures to limit purchase of some items attracted criticisms from “a minority group”.

&gt; Another issue of trust in the government concerns the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA), which some view as an attempt to stifle dissent on the internet, said Prof Yaacob.

&gt; “There is a sense among them that the government is using this legislation for its own agenda, rather than serving the needs of all people,” he added.

&gt; Last month in Parliament, Minister of Communications and Information S Iswaran had called it “a coincidence” that the first few cases brought under the law were against political figures and parties.

&gt; Prof Yaacob noted that he is “all too familiar” with such concerns, citing his move to license online news sites in 2013 when he was still in the Cabinet.

&gt; Several internet groups had then alleged that the move would kill the diversity of voices on the internet, said Prof Yaacob.

&gt; “As it turns out, the licensing scheme did not stifle the internet at all. Many groups continue to flourish on the internet,” he added.

&gt; “All we wanted – and I'm sure all of us can agree to this – is responsible behaviour on the internet, especially when the issues affect the lives of so many Singaporeans.”

&gt; Prof Yaacob stressed that the issue of trust “will continue to arise” as Singapore grapple with increasingly complex issues, such as climate changes and technological advances.

&gt; Dealing with the effects of climate change will “raise many questions” about how the government should best use its limited fiscal resources for the good of Singapore, he noted.

&gt; “And the government would need to build trust that it is doing what is right for people, even though it means spending significant resources for a very long term period to benefit future generations,” Prof Yaacob added.

&gt; On technology, while Singaporeans trust that the government is using the data captured – from closed-circuit television cameras in void decks and other common areas – for good, it is not the case in other countries.

&gt; “In places like San Francisco, the residents have voted against having videos in public places. For our own digitisation efforts to succeed, people must trust that the data is collected solely for the purpose of developing useful services for them,” he said.

&gt; By all accounts, while Singapore has done well in this area thus far, Prof Yaacob pointed out that it is not inconceivable for some people to raise the issues of data privacy.

&gt; The emergence of data protection legislation overseas, such as the European Union General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act, may also cause some to wonder whether Singapore’s Personal Data Protection Act is sufficiently rigorous.

&gt; “My intent in raising this issue is that for all of us to be cognisant of the potential hazards awaiting us in our journey towards digitalising of our economy and society,” said Prof Yaacob.

&gt; The questions of trust brought about by the use of technology in everyday lives can range from whether the government can protect Singaporeans from being manipulated by the big tech giants to whether Singaporeans can trust the government to use “personal data for the benefit of all Singaporeans and not (for) some political agenda”.

&gt; “We have seen how trust is broken down in other societies leading to the rise of populism and with social media, and the rise of misinformation and alternative facts, sometimes it is unclear whether the lack of trust in government is an effect of these developments, or is it the cause of the rise of other alternative centres of trust,” he noted.

&gt; Citing Singaporeans’ high trust in public institutions here to do what is right, Prof Yaacob suggested for the Republic to consider creating an independent digital commission to build trust in ensuring new technologies, such as artificial intelligence and the use of machine learning algorithms, are used correctly.

&gt; “We cannot avoid the nagging concerns of privacy and transparency that digitalisation will bring. If we do not deal with this early, then trust in government can be eroded,” he added.

**As the outbreak of the coronavirus that originated from Wuhan  continues to intensify, some in Singapore have had to comply with  quarantine or leave of absence requirements to do their part in stemming  the spread. Similarly, some Singaporeans in Wuhan are taking their own  precautions as the city enters its second week of lockdown.**

For the past 10 years, Singaporean K. Ho has called Wuhan home.

He is fully aware that the capital of Hubei province is the epicentre  of the coronavirus outbreak, but Mr Ho, who is in his 40s, is not  overly worried about staying on in the city.

""I am comfortable here. In fact, it is quite cosy to stay home during  winter,"" he told The Straits Times in a phone interview last Friday.

Mr Ho, a senior manager in manufacturing, has been holed up in his  apartment with his Chinese wife and their three-year-old son since Jan  23, when the city was put under lockdown, bringing its airport, train  stations and public transport to a standstill.

The restrictions placed on vehicles and the government's call on  people to stay indoors have made the city look ""like a ghost town"", he  added.

But that is not unusual during the Chinese New Year period as most  people travel to other parts of China to celebrate, he said, adding that  the supermarkets and pharmacies near his home are well stocked.

Like most of the 140 or so Singaporeans staying put in Wuhan, Mr Ho's spouse is not a Singaporean.

He met his wife in Wuhan, where he has lived since 2010.

Despite social media posts and news reports often portraying an  alarming picture of the city, he said life is normal. ""Well, except for  the fact that you need to stay indoors and can't leave the city.""

Still, the family takes precautions even at home, which is about 20km  from Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, named as ground zero of the  epidemic that has spread to more than 20 countries.

The family members take their temperature daily, while his wife  washes her hands and disinfects her coat whenever she returns from the  supermarket.

The only time there was a commotion in the city was when news came of the lockdown, Mr Ho said.

""There was panic buying as people snatched up most of the food at the  supermarkets. But there wasn't any shoving or shouting,"" he added,  noting that the checkout took over two hours because of the long queues.

""The next day, the shelves were fully stocked again.""

The family had been due to take an early morning flight to Singapore  on Jan 24 to celebrate Chinese New Year, but when they received news in  the wee hours of the morning of Jan 23 that a lockdown would start at  10am, he knew there would be problems.

""I wasn't exactly shocked at the news because we had heard some  chatter. But this meant we had seven hours to get out of the city.""

As foreigners and locals scrambled to pack and leave before the  lockdown, Mr Ho and his family decided it would be better to stay put.

""There were many uncertainties, like what if we went to another city and were quarantined because we came from Wuhan?

""Travelling with a toddler is also a challenge. What if we get caught in another city and can't make it back to Singapore?""

At the same time, he was confident that Wuhan would not run out of  water or food. ""I felt many resources would be diverted to Wuhan because  of the lockdown - that is why I was assured we would be all right.""

He has not left his home in the 14 days since the start of the  lockdown, but work has kept him busy. He has also been helping to  coordinate efforts for clients and colleagues who want to leave the  city.

He and his family are under ""self-imposed quarantine"", but he does not feel imprisoned or stuck.

""With an active toddler at home, you hardly find time to be bored or  think about other things,"" he said, adding that it is not too different  from how he spends his weekends.

Mr Ho did not to get on the special Jan 30 Scoot flight that  evacuated 92 Singaporeans from Wuhan, after he had heard that spouses  who are Chinese nationals would not be able to board the plane.

But hours after it took off, the Chinese government announced that it  would let Chinese nationals who are family members of foreigners take  evacuation flights.

Mr Ho, who is in contact with other Singaporeans in Hubei, said some are trying to arrange for another flight out.

""But I am not sure if I want to get on that flight. It might be safer  to remain indoors and avoid crowded places,"" he said, adding that he  baulked at the idea of being quarantined on arriving in Singapore.

C) He is kinda wrong. 

I 100% believe that OP is following a narrative with this post about a scenario he sees, nothing else. While I'm not saying he is wrong I'm also more inclined to listen to both sides. This post would have been alot better if he opened up a discussion with different experts. But he only posted some experts and that's it. Again, this post is very unnecessary.

Marc, Jennifer and maybe even Gregory Poland is indeed very relevant to this discussion, however, they did not say it will 100% become a pandemic either. I might be wrong and not updated with the latest information, please correct me then.

Marc - Give his twitter a go, really good read about this subject. He does think a pandemic is likely but he didnt say it will 100% become one. He is talking about bunch of different scenarios and what could happen for Corona to not become a pandemic. I would not put him in the 100% category but more Likely pandemic.

Jennifer - Also very good but she also said it may become a pandemic. I would not put Jennifer in the 100% category either.

Gregory Poland - “We’re basically at a pandemic now,”.

According to the people you find relevant i would say that 1/3 are saying it will become a pandemic. The others are likely but still, I have no idea why this is relevant. I did not say they was wrong or anything. I said why trust x more than y. Bring both opinions up to debate instead of pushing a narrative down peoples throat on reddit.",0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

CORONAVIRUS: DEACONESS ASKS PUBLIC TO SEW CDC-COMPLIANT FACE MASKS FOR STAFF ""PRIOR TO MODERN DISPOSABLE MASKS, WASHABLE FABRIC MASKS WERE STANDARD USE FOR HOSPITALS""

Coronavirus: Deaconess asks public to sew CDC-compliant face masks for staff

&amp;#x200B;

Thomas B. Langhorne, Evansville Courier &amp; Press Published 12:48 p.m. CT March 18, 2020 | Updated 2:07 p.m. CT March 20, 2020

&amp;#x200B;

Deaconess Nurse Practitioner Dawn Rogers speaks about the public rush on face masks at pharmacies and notes the need for those supplies for the sick. Evansville Courier &amp; Press

&amp;#x200B;

EVANSVILLE, Ind. — Citing shortages, Deaconess Health System, including Henderson's Methodist Health, has asked the public to sew face masks for staff fighting coronavirus.

&amp;#x200B;

""This does follow CDC protocols that you can find on their website that if all other supplies are not available, that handmade masks that meet certain criteria are acceptable,"" Deaconess spokeswoman Becca Scott said.

&amp;#x200B;

The release with the video, pattern and instructions was posted to the Deaconess Facebook page Thursday morning and is available at [www.deaconess.com/masks](https://www.deaconess.com/masks). A PDF of the pattern is available here and embedded at the bottom of this article.

&amp;#x200B;

Deaconess has ""a sample video"" about how to make the masks, which Scott said will be sterilized when they come in.

&amp;#x200B;

""This is not outside CDC guidelines if other supplies are exhausted. And so we want to have these coming in,"" Scott said.

&amp;#x200B;

Shortages of specialized masks moved federal health officials this month to liberalize their recommendations about which face protection front line health-care workers should use to ward off the highly contagious disease stemming from coronavirus.

&amp;#x200B;

“Prior to modern disposable masks, washable fabric masks were standard use for hospitals,” said Dawn Rogers, MSN, RN, FNP-C, Patient Safety &amp; Infection Prevention Office in a release to media. “We will be able to sterilize these masks and use them repeatedly as needed. While it’s less than ideal, we want to do our best to protect our staff and patients during this pandemic.”

&amp;#x200B;

In their instructions, the hospital asked:

&amp;#x200B;

Use tightly-woven cotton fabric.

&amp;#x200B;

Please remember that both women and men in a variety of roles may wear these masks.

&amp;#x200B;

When your masks are complete, please call 812-450-8673 to arrange delivery. (You will be met in a facility parking lot at a pre-arranged time.)

&amp;#x200B;

Collected masks will be immediately sent to laundry/processing to be prepared for use.

&amp;#x200B;

Any surplus masks will be distributed to other organizations in need.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The CDC posted new guidelines stating that “the supply chain of respirators cannot meet demand” and that looser-fitting surgical face masks “are an acceptable alternative"" to specialized masks commonly known as N95 respirators. Surgical face masks can block the respiratory droplets of coughing or sneezing patients — the principal way the virus is spread.

&amp;#x200B;

Experts say the N95s filter out about 95 percent of airborne particles, while the more common surgical masks reduce — but don't eliminate — the odds of inhaling large, infectious particles. The CDC had been recommending health-care workers who work closely with coronavirus patients or those suspected of being infected wear N95 respirators, gloves, gowns and eye protection gear.

&amp;#x200B;

The CDC recommends N95 respirators be reserved for protecting workers in more dangerous and risky settings. The CDC guidelines also recommend health-care facilities consider alternatives to the N95 masks.

&amp;#x200B;

Researchers have studied recent flu season infection rates among health care workers at seven U.S. medical centers. Workers assigned to wear N95 respirators and others wearing surgical masks demonstrated no significant difference in flu infection rates, according to the study published in September in the Journal of the American Medical Association.

&amp;#x200B;

To counteract shortages, federal health officials plan to purchase 500 million N95 respirators over the next 18 months.

&amp;#x200B;

Vice President Mike Pence said this week that President Trump's administration supports legislation that “would extend temporary liability protections, so (N95) masks made for industrial use could be sold so hospital workers could be protected.” Pence said that would “make more N95 masks available.”

Chemo Buddies asking for mask donations, too

&amp;#x200B;

Jill Kincaid, Chemo Buddies Founder and CEO, said chemotherapy patients are one of the largest at-risk groups for any germs, including COVID-19. She said those at treatment centers have been told there are no masks for them.

&amp;#x200B;

Kincaid said Chemo Buddies is stepping up with volunteers who are willing to make masks and are asking for other donations. She asks people drop off completed masks to their office at 3700 Bellemeade Ave, Suite 118. THey will be laundered and delivered to infusion centers.

328,"For me this has been a slow and agonizing slide. I'm a Comic Con vendor and work part time at a bead shop. We've been grinding ever downward since 2016. In 2019 first we had in-person sales tank even worse than the general economy. Next my supplies tripled in price AGAIN. Hong Kong and China fight means I can't get gold plated items so discontinue my most popular item. Then shipping went up. Then listing fees and transaction fees for my online sales went up. Online sales then had sales tax applied automatically instead of being included in my item price (I use VAT and lump sum my quarterly taxes per state). I now have to spend more than double the time filing taxes because my reports per state are now wrong because I pay in person and online on 2 other sites but 1 site decided to submit reports for us! This time takes away from making, photographing, and marketing time, so I post fewer new items for sale. Shows begin to die off as bankruptcies, consolidations, and rescheduling or relocating rocks the industry. Others increased booth fees to make up for lower ticket sales. Due to loss of selling days and acceptable profit margin I'm behind on my business bills and taxes (so goodbye remaining profit as I'm now paying compound interest and late fees). Because I'm late my credit is now bad and I can't get a consolidation loan to reduce the total payments due. Next my online sales and consignment store sales went down massively over 2018 too because of the market contraction. 

Enter Covid19. My parts dry up because Chinese manufacturing can't ship anything. My backup sources in other countries (more expensive) take over briefly, but then have to shut down too. As the virus spreads into Seattle my biggest show gets cancelled. Other shows start rescheduling for 2021 as no crowd rules go into effect. All 1st quarter shows are rescheduled for later this year (so I had to cancel some due to schedule conflicts) others are now ""date TBD"". My fees are rolling to the next show when it happens so no cash refund to pay other bills (can't resent this as refund would bankrupt the show producers). Online sales drop off completely as no one is buying cosplay items if they aren't going to a show or filming and performing. My store now cuts hours radically and cancels all classes and Bead Night because of social distancing. 

""Stay at Home Order"" goes through as of today. The store is now closed outright as are all stores where I have pieces consigned. We aren't even allowed to go do inventory to keep workers occupied.This is probably going to put my store out of business permanently because we weren't even making a profit. It's a break even business before this started and the owner has even more debt than I do. She can't even pay to have full time employees. I have no paycheck and no consignment sales. I'm waiting on clarification if I'm allowed to ship goods if anyone orders as it's not ""essential business"" for me to go to the post office. The post office is open and making delivery but for how long will they ship things other than ""essential"" packages? 

Normally I can't file for Unemployment because I'm self employed. I'm not disabled enough to get benefits but I'm too disabled to go back to my old career. I'm hoping the rules change because I am totally and utterly fucked otherwise. My husband's job is probably not in danger. He's at home call center tech support for a bank and is now doing not just mandatory overtime but ""voluntary"" part time on weekends too, poor guy. The Philippines and India call centers are closed right now because of quarantine. He says he might as well work every hour he can because there's fuck all else to do. I will not starve or lose my house, unlike a lot of my friends in the industry. 

My husband pays for mortgage, insurance, water &amp; power, internet, car payment, and ""not gonna starve"" food. My income pays for clothes, cell phone, streaming tv and games, gas for the car, ""nice"" groceries, office equipment, cat food, litter, vet, and anything extra like family visiting, presents, or emergency expenses. Except for the cat food and litter we'll survive without my income pretty long in this emergency.

On a side note, I have been in self quarantine for 21 days now so lost my paycheck from those weeks we were open too. I would have had to cancel Seattle even if he show went on. I had what I thought was flu, but flu does NOT last for 21 days so tomorrow my doc is calling to see if I need to go to the hospital and get tested for pneumonia and possibly Covid19. Pretty sure I don't have Covid19 as the symptoms aren't really a match but they keep updating the symptoms lists now so... Wish me luck.",1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0
329,"When they made us come home from holiday.

We were supposed to spend 20 days in egypt. 

It was pretty calm there. No one was hoarding food, no one was hoarding masks. Sure it was a bit quieter than usual at the big locations like the pyramids and Abu Simbel, but that was a benefit in our eyes.  No one in our group was really worried about egypt and the wifi was poor so we had no clue what was happening in the netherlands.

Our tour guide gave us the ""corona update"" every day, but for the first ten day the update was just ""all is calm, do not worry"".

Then in the middle of the day the guide called our group for a meeting and said ""well we still have ten days to go but our return flight over Austria-Vienna has been cancelled so we can't return like that. But the travel agency is working on it and we still have 10 more days so we'll find you a different flight home. Dont worry and enjoy the pool. ""

  
So we all merrily toddled off to the pool and then went out to get some late lunch with the group when one groupmember checked his phone (he had a simcard with internet on it so he was connected) and he had a message from the guide.

It basically said ""You are all going home tomorrow. Pack your stuff. We're putting you on an airplane tonight.""

We were so confused. It became clear that Egypt was closing it's airports on wednesday night.

It mainly hit me hard because up to that point i had barely any idea what was going on. People in egypt just went along with their daily business. I had hardly any contact with the Netherlands. When i left home they had 80 cases, when i came back they had hit 2000. 

The difference of ten days had changed the airports considerably. When I first came to Cairo airport all was well.  Then ten days later everyone was wearing full hazmat suits. Same for London heathrow and Schiphol. 

The shock for me came because i had been ignoring it and enjoying my holiday, then suddenly WHAM, go home. So it was suddenly real for me.",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0

The American president, Donald Trump, announced Wednesday, March 11 in the evening, the suspension for thirty days from Friday of all the trips of foreigners from Europe to the United States to stem the epidemic due to the coronavirus , which killed 38 people and more than 1,200 cases of contamination in the country.

""I have decided to take strong but necessary actions to protect the health and well-being of all Americans,"" Trump said in a formal address from the Oval Office of the White House. ""To prevent new cases from entering our country, I will suspend all travel from Europe to the United States for the next 30 days,"" he added, regretting that the European Union does not did not take ""the same precautions"" as the United States faced with the spread of the virus.

This new measure will come into force at midnight Friday (5 a.m. in France). It applies to the Schengen area and does not concern the United Kingdom, said the republican billionaire.

During his ten-minute speech, the president of the world's leading power described Covid-19 as a “foreign virus” . A few days ago, the American chief of diplomacy, Mike Pompeo, had caused a controversy, and the ire of Beijing, speaking of ""Wuhan virus"" .

The 45 th  President of the United States concluded his speech by hammering out his conviction that the future of the United States remained ""brighter than anyone can imagine"" .

He is accused by a number of elected Democrats of wanting to minimize at all costs the scale of the coming health crisis and to send confusing messages, sometimes contradicting those of the health authorities. ""It will disappear, stay calm,"" he said on Tuesday. “Everything is going well. A lot of good things are going to take place . ”

Helping American households
Donald Trump also called on Congress on Wednesday to quickly adopt payroll tax cuts to help American households weather the economic impact of the Covid-19 epidemic. This proposal made by his administration at the beginning of the week did not have a very favorable response with elected officials, including his own party.

The American president also announced the postponement of the deadline of payment of the taxes for certain individuals and companies and thus reinject “200 billion dollars of additional liquidity in the economy” .

&gt;U.S. Virus Plan Anticipates 18-Month Pandemic and Widespread Shortages

&gt;WASHINGTON — A federal government plan to combat the coronavirus warned policymakers last week that a pandemic “will last 18 months or longer” and could include “multiple waves,” resulting in widespread shortages that would strain consumers and the nation’s health care system.

&gt;The 100-page plan, dated Friday, the same day President Trump declared a national emergency, laid out a grim prognosis for the spread of the virus and outlined a response that would activate agencies across the government and potentially employ special presidential powers to mobilize the private sector.

&gt;Among the “additional key federal decisions” listed among the options for Mr. Trump was invoking the Defense Production Act of 1950, a Korean War-era law that authorizes a president to take extraordinary action to force American industry to ramp up production of critical equipment and supplies such as ventilators, respirators and protective gear for health care workers.

&gt;“Shortages of products may occur, impacting health care, emergency services, and other elements of critical infrastructure,” the plan warned. “This includes potentially critical shortages of diagnostics, medical supplies (including PPE and pharmaceuticals), and staffing in some locations.” P.P.E. refers to personal protective equipment.

&gt;The plan continued: “State and local governments, as well as critical infrastructure and communications channels, will be stressed and potentially less reliable. These stresses may also increase the challenges of getting updated messages and coordinating guidance to these jurisdictions directly.”",0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The best thing to do is wash your hands regular and never touch your face. If someone have corona, wearing gloves arent going to stop transmitting the virus to food.

But i agree that the risk of getting virus from eating carry out seem low. At the very least it seems the risk of getting it is the same as going grocery shopping on your own and cook your own food. But i lean toward making my own.

First, I want to point out that every life matters, not just the ones of people who we agree with.  Second, I would like to remind you that not everyone affected by this decision was supportive of it.  There are numerous members of both the faculty and staff who strongly oppose the decisions Jerry Falwell Jr. has made over the past few weeks.  They have been put at risk just as much as the community, or the students.  They are also people who live amongst the community and genuinely care about the students who they have taught and served.  These are people who are often overflowing with love towards others, and this crisis has them battling extreme fear for themselves and their community as well as self-punishment for not being able to make any changes to what's happening.  Everyone needs a paycheck... Unfortunately, Liberty is often ruled by fear and not many have the courage to speak out.  But I ask everyone here to remember these people as well as others who disagree with this course of action rather than lumping everyone together as careless, hateful people.  Many have still been forced to come to work at non-essential locations in order to prove Jerry Jr's point, but that does not mean they do not care about the community or that they are not taking the outbreak seriously.

336,"&gt; Did the Chinese deceive the world with the Corona Virus? And they saved their economy ?!
&gt; 
&gt; This is what the Americans and Europeans think, after they sold their shares in high-value-added technology companies for a minimal price to the Chinese government.
&gt; 
&gt; According to them, the Chinese leadership used an “economic tactic” that made everyone swallow the bait easily, before they asserted that China did not resort to implementing a high political strategy to get rid of European investors, in support of China’s economy, which would bypass the US economy with this step ..!
&gt; 
&gt; And because it teaches the science of certainty that Europeans and Americans are looking for excuses to slow and bankrupt the Chinese economy, China has sacrificed some hundreds of its citizens, instead of sacrificing an entire people ..!
&gt; 
&gt; Through this tactic, China succeeded in “deceiving all”, as it reaped about $ 20 billion in two days, and the Chinese president succeeded in deceiving the European Union and the United States of America in the eyes of the world, and played an economic game of a tactical nature, which was unthinkable. !
&gt; 
&gt; Before the Corona virus, most of the stocks and stakes in investment projects at “Technology and Chemicals” production plants were owned by European and American investors ..!
&gt; 
&gt; This means that more than half of the profits from the light and heavy technological and chemical industries went to the hands of foreign investors, not to the Chinese treasury, which led to a decline in the Chinese currency, the yuan, .. and the Chinese central bank could not To do something against the continuous fall of the yuan ..!
&gt; 
&gt; There was even widespread news that China was unable to purchase masks to prevent the spread of the deadly virus. These rumors and the Chinese President’s statements that he is “not ready to save the country from the virus” have led to a sharp drop in the purchase prices of shares of technology companies in China, and the empires of “foreign” investors have raced to offer investment shares for sale at very low prices, and with attractive offers, “Never seen before” in history ..!
&gt; 
&gt; The Chinese government waited for foreign share prices to reach their “almost free” minimums, and then issued an order to purchase them. And bought the shares of Americans and Europeans ..!
&gt; 
&gt; And when European and American investment financiers realized that they had been deceived, it was too late, as the shares were in the hands of the Chinese government, which in this process nationalized most of the foreign companies erected on its soil in a near-free manner, without causing a political crisis or a single shot .. !
&gt; 
&gt; The same sources confirmed and pointed out that “Corona” is a “real” virus, but it is not a terrible danger that has been promoted across the world ..!

340,"The truth is that the medical community, the historical community, and in general social advocates, all tend to agree. Quarantine, in general, is an outdated method that rarely works but sounds really good. 

Obviously you can find ways to make any tactic look bad. That’s not going to go away no matter *what* technique you use. Quarantine? Raise the ire of the people, break their trust in the government, create far greater risk for the people inside the walls than they were in before. Isolation? Potential blowbacks from people with guns, possible damages to families, so on. 

There is no magical cure to the situation. There’s no “one way that’s best” to be had. Quarantines have one result, isolation has another. The question becomes which one has the least consequences. 

&gt;	Quarantining cities is probably significantly easier, cut off all the major exits and most won’t be able to go anywhere. Call a state of emergency and use the military, which most governments of the world are able to do.

This is where the whole thing falls apart. Unless you’re willing to put up literal walls around the city and station military around the city willing to shoot anyone who tries to escape then you haven no real way of being sure it’s going to work. 

“Use the military” to do what, exactly? A strong physical presence isn’t going to deter people who are truly terrified and rebellious. You’re either going to have to kill them, which absolutely breaks trust in the situation, or you need to be able to truly lock it down such that they can’t escape at all. 

Let’s not forget that you have to be able to put up the quarantine fast enough that no one can, well, just leave. That pretty much doesn’t happen. Unless you can roll the military in, quietly, while everyone is asleep and suddenly have a lockdown some people are just going to leave through unprotected exits. Those people might be sick and the lock down was, on some level, ineffective. 

Even more importantly: 

Now that everyone has seen what happened in Wuhan, how many Chinese people do you believe are going to be willing to seek help? There are legitimately people who would rather die free in their homes than risk being locked down.

It’s important to remember that the reaction to China’s response is incredibly mixed. Some praise it as a Hail Mary that successfully cordoned off a virus. Others point out that there *are* cases outside of the lock down and that those cases may well be spreading quietly without report precisely *because* no one wants to go through Wuhan. 

As to the question of: 

&gt;	Even further, why would anyone volunteer to get tested when they could end up locked away for two weeks?

This is no less true of a quarantine than it is of isolation. Let’s say that all of Boston locked down. No one in, no one out. The sick just keep spreading it amongst each other and we all sit here watching them get sick, some die, some don’t, but they’re all trapped; jobless, without comfort or resources. 

Now imagine you live in Manchester. You come down with a cold. Are *you* going to go to the doctor and get tested, knowing what’s happening in Boston? I’d argue you’re even less likely because now it’s not just you that might be locked down, it’s your friends and family and everyone you know. 

The two aren’t really all that different in terms of how people react to it, per se, but only one of them puts everyone inside an area at greater risk.",0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0
341,"That's actually an interesting thing I've been wanting to ask a Democrat about. Just because I'm exercising my right not to vote for a presidential candidate I absolutely despise (well I despise both of them), why does that mean I'm suddenly voting for Trump? I'm voting down ballot only - I won't be checking a box next to either of their names. 

I didn't say it was speculative for Trump and I apologize if it came off that way - he fucked it up really badly as we've all seen. It's speculative for Biden because I think he's just as incompetent, he's also shown his true colors multiple times and his interests  align with big business. I agree with you that Jared Kushner shouldn't be anywhere near the government, but who knows who Joe Biden is going to fill his cabinet out with. He was talking about potentially having key positions for people like Bloomberg. Come on - you really want Bloomberg to have a say over things that have to do with how this country is run? I'm pretty damn sure Bernie wouldn't be bringing in corporate hawks like that to try and establish policy. This entire talking point has gotten a little bit outside of the scope of the original intent - at the end of the day it comes down to Trumps handling of COVID isn't enough to make me vote for Joe Biden. 

I think it's a little bit unfair to ask me to develop empathy. I'm very empathetic towards people who are struggling in this country, so much so I was willing to vote for a candidate that would hurt my bottom line financially, as well as institute sweeping social policies to give more opportunities to people who fall outside of the demographic I fit into. His intent in office wouldn't be to improve my life it would be to improve the lives of people less fortunate which I'm all for. What I'm not empathetic towards are moderate liberals with this idea that somehow Biden is going to be the right choice for this country, especially when they try to champion themselves as the people who care about everyone. It's highly likely that some social safety nets will be eaten into and the people who struggle the most won't get the same kind of change they possibly would from a President who would actively push the narrative that how we treat them is not okay. Not one thing will change under Biden versus Trump from my perspective, aside from choosing his words with a little more care, unless of course someone calls him out and he tells them he's going to meet them outside like a god damn lunatic. You may not agree with this at all but it's my POV on the situation and I'm entitled to it in the same way you're entitled to yours. If people in this country don't want sweeping reform to help improve the lives of the less fortunate I'm under no moral obligation to help maintain some weird status quo in politics for moderate liberals to sleep better at night.

Sure, it was using an over the top example to explain that the handling of the COVID situation is not changing my mind about Biden. Justifying it by saying he may have handled it in the same way is probably a little extreme, but if you can't tell I really dislike this guy for my own reasons which have 0 to do with him beating Bernie. It'd be hard to fuck it up as badly as Trump but if anyone can do it it's Joe Biden. Honestly the Democrats could've trotted anyone else out from the primary (except Bloomberg) and you would've gotten my vote. I even voted for HC back in 2016 if that means anything to you. Joe Biden is my line, and a lot of independent/progressives line, in the sand. Under no circumstance will I be complicit in handing over control of this countries highest office to him.",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

“Why on God’s green earth can I go to Target and buy these items when so many hospitals are running out?” he asked. “If they are available at Target, there are certainly more sitting at a distribution center somewhere. We need these in our hospitals right now.”

Several large hospital chains said they had adequate supplies for now, though they have taken steps to ration their use. The George Washington University Hospital in Washington, D.C., has told heath care workers they can use a respirator mask five times before discarding it, and it is keeping its supply of masks under lock and key.

“We’ve experienced outright theft, with the general public walking into our building and walking right out,” said Bruno Petinaux, the hospital’s chief medical officer.

Smaller hospitals and nonprofit clinics, especially those that lack centralized supply operations, are moving aggressively to conserve their gear. In an effort to save precious supplies, Chatham Hospital in Siler City, N.C., is only allowing one doctor and one nurse to examine patients with symptoms of respiratory distress.

Some hospitals are employing more heavy-handed tactics. Saint Peter’s Healthcare System in New Jersey on Wednesday warned doctors in an email they could be disciplined for wearing masks when not examining patients.

On Thursday, volunteers with knives, rulers and masking tape gathered at the headquarters of Providence St. Joseph Health to cobble together face shields for the system’s thousands of caregivers. In Oregon, health officials in Multnomah County are calling on the public to donate any rubber gloves, goggles or face masks they might have at home or work. The county, which includes Portland, has little more than a week before critical supplies run out.

“Every pandemic is local so you have to pull on those local strings so we can help each other,” said Julie Sullivan-Springhetti, a health department spokesperson.

But with limited prospects for speedy government intervention, fear and anxiety continue to mount. In recent days, hundreds of medical workers have taken to social media with public pleas for help using the hashtag #GetMePPE. (P.P.E. stands for personal protective equipment.)

A doctor at Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis described how she and her colleagues intubated a trauma patient they later discovered was likely infected with Covid-19. All of them wore simple face masks as they worked just inches from the patient’s face.

The swabs don’t take up fluid as good either. After switching the swabs the lab results have gotten an extreme amount of raised false negatives.

The labs at the same time also raised the levels of testing. Meaning if you have a lower level of viral or bacteria in your throat, it goes as a false negative result.
Only once a patient has gotten really sick and really ill, will the test pick up a positive results because by then the viral load or bacteria has spread.
A lot of doctors I’ve met have expressed annoyance over this and all the false negatives. I’ve gotten false negatives several times for common throat bacterial infections due to this.

346,"Pets are going to be a very dangerous vector of transmission in the US.

A lot of people are going to be killed because of infected pets. If you have a pet, it is your responsibility to keep it indoors and quarantines, regardless of it being infected or not until this blows over. If you take your pet outside there is a high chance it will be infected (dog parts, yard etc where the virus will linger).

This sub and others are filled with inconsiderate idiots who think their pets are more important than other humans. When I posted scientific evidence I was downvoted to oblivion. 

If  this corona virus is anything like past corona virus (SARS) having pets  around is a very bad idea. Pets can catch and spread the virus. Pretty  stupid to be hanging around animals they can carry zoonotic diseases.

347,"I'm pretty well-informed, have a background in medicine, was on the front lines of one big media hysteria epidemic and a couple others that weren't so big, I've been reading the literature, and I know a lot of people on the front lines of this one who I talk to regularly. I'm not worried. None of the people I know are worried. The data is promising, and the CDC has everything under control.

If that's what you're hearing from the government, it's not ""sweeping-shit-under-the-rug nonsense"", it's just the reality. COVID-19 is serious, nobody's saying it's not, but it's not the kind of serious that should result in panic. The medical community deals with serious things every day. Just because something is serious doesn't mean they don't know how, or lack the ability, to handle them.

The proper response to COVID-19 is cautious preparation and prevention, the exact same preparation and prevention you should be doing anyway for regular flu season. Those of you who normally get a flu vaccine every year (good for you!), you may be extra worried about COVID-19 not having a vaccine yet, and that's understandable. But it's important to remember (and if you didn't know this, now you know) that getting a flu vaccine doesn't mean you can't get the flu. There's always some strains going around that don't make it into the yearly vaccine, and vaccines aren't 100% anyway, so you should always act as if you're not vaccinated, flu shot or not flu shot.

Epidemiology is a pretty complicated thing. While I would like to think that a lot of people could probably understand the situation if explained at a basic enough level, a lot probably still wouldn't, and it doesn't help that our media are scientifically illiterate. They went to journalism school and at their jobs they're told ""if it bleeds, it leads"". That's not conducive to a well-informed public. People are prone to thinking there are conspiracies or cover-ups. In an epidemic, there are actual unknowns, both knowable unknowns and unknown unknowables. The CDC can't give a complete picture because they don't have a complete picture. Giving out information that proves to be wrong in the long run makes people trust them less when it's really important. Not giving out information they simply don't have, only makes people think things are worse than they're being told.

It's also just a fact that the best informed people on these subjects aren't typically the best communicators.

The government has lots of reasons to want the public not to panic. The government also has zero reasons to want the public to get sick and die. Those are taxpayers, voters, soldiers and law enforcement, productive citizens of every type. If you are unable to believe that the people managing the crisis have a desire to manage the outbreak as best as they can, I don't know what to tell you, you're probably too far gone off the deep end of crazy town for anything I'm telling you to matter. But if you are able to believe that the people in the CDC, at the hospitals, in the emergency medical services have only the best intentions, then listen to me now.

It's going to be okay. The best people in the entire world are working on the problem, in and outside of government. These are people who have been managing epidemics big and small their whole careers, many of them for decades. They've seen it all, and they're not panicking. COVID-19 is a new strain, but coronavirus is one of the most studied, best-understood viruses there is. The US medical community has had plenty of warning about this outbreak, have experience with other coronaviruses, and have taken all appropriate steps.

I don't check my reddit inbox all that frequently, but if anyone has any specific concerns they'd like me to address, things that are causing you to panic about COVID-19, I'd be happy to answer any replies to this post asking about things you think people ought to be panicking about.

Doubt it. Right now, people are likely too nervous and afraid of the virus to do anything drastic. Once the crisis ends, people will likely be more focused on trying to get the economy back up and running and put food on the table. By the time the economy is back up and people aren't in immediate risk of either dying of the virus or lack of resources, the Party's justification for remaining in power is restored.

&gt;Hong Kong will have greater independence.

I call non-sequitur.

&gt;Companies will diversify production outside of China.

Some part of me is curious if this will see the re-rise of Japan and this becomes the 1980s all over again. I'll laugh if that ends up happening. But yes, I would expect companies to start veering away from states with less than desirable sanitation practices, which would also exclude India as a potential replacement for China.

&gt;China will be severely weakened economically.

I somewhat agree and disagree here. China will be weakened in the short term as its economy takes a dump due to highly restricted exporting while the virus is ongoing. immediately following the end of the crisis, I would expect things to return to &gt;90% of their normal level. The factories will still be in China and physical capital takes time to relocate. I imagine the CPC would do everything in their power to try and encourage firms to continue operations in the PRC, with mixed results. Long-term, I expect by the end of this decade that China will see somewhat diminished economic growth as a result of this, if it continues as present. If the virus becomes much worse, I expect that China will have become a very undesirable place for business, spurring the establishment of manufacturing ability someplace else.

&gt;ump will be re-elected in a landslide because of his anti-globalist, anti-China stance on a platform of ""I told you so"" and ""I will keep you safe"" and ""Bernie Sanders is a communist. Communism brings you coronavirus.""

While I expect the incumbent US president to win reelection, I imagine it will be by a normal margin for an incumbent, assuming the virus gets no worse. If it becomes dramatically worse, then I would actually expect him to *lose* in a landslide, as a result of the US economy taking a hit from the sudden severing of Chinese manufacturing. Regardless of what actual powers the office has, people have a tendency to praise or blame the president for the economy's success or failure, regardless of the actual cause. In essence, I argue his reelection depends on the economy. If the economy is still afloat by November, then I give the incumbent &gt;80% odds of victory. If the economy is teetering on the brink, break-even odds, if in a rather bad recession, &lt;30% odds of victory.

&gt; Masks filter out particles of approximately 2 microns and larger. COVID-19 is 0.125 microns in size. That right there means your mask will NOT filter out this virus. It’ll pass right through your mask like a cat going through a doggie door.

It is my understanding that the covid-19 is in respiratory droplets, which I assume are larger than 0.125 microns in size.   I may be wrong about this, but seems like the filter would protect you from those.  Does the virus itself just float around by itself in the air?   Maybe it does, but I am unclear on that point.

&gt; Is it an N95 mask? I’m assuming it’s a disposable one, right? 

It is RZ M2 N95 mask.  I know it has replaceable filter.  I don't think the entire mask is supposed to be disposable, but again I could be wrong.

&gt;  If it has the virus on it and you put it on your counter, guess what? Now the virus is on your counter. You’ll probably touch the counter when you go to move the mask, so now it’s on your hands.

Ok, good points there.  But then don't put it on the counter (although I already did that).  Perhaps put it in a ziplock bag and only take it out after you have gloves on.  Not a perfect solution, but better?

&gt; That N95 you have, does it completely seal on your face? 

I think so, but I know this can be tricky  and was thinking about getting some medical tape to put at the top of it where it may not seal perfectly around my nose.  It is difficult to tell for sure.

&gt; But please use the right mask, and use it the right way. You’re acting like you’re invincible because you have a mask, but the truth is that if you’re not using it properly, especially if you’re reusing disposable masks, you’d actually be safer without it.

Ok, you make some good points here, and I am listening.  What do you think of that M2 RZ M95 mask?

If I, personally, were going to die of a disease -- I had a crystal ball and knew it was coming and had to chose between Covid and Ebola? I'd pick Ebola.

See, I've spent time in the hospital with viral pneumonia so bad I couldn't draw a breath. I was scary close to being put on a vent -- they wanted to, but there were worse cases in the hospital who needed it more, because it was a bad flu season. I recovered anyway. I have never forgotten the terror of being unable to draw a complete breath, of panting desperately for air, of knowing that the nice nurse sitting 24/7 by my bed was there in case I stopped breathing entirely or had a heart attack. It hurt. I was soooo tired but couldn't sleep. I couldn't eat. All my energy was focused on trying to get enough oxygen in. I remember begging for the another nebulizer treatment minutes after the last one, even though the previous one hadn't helped. I remember the sheer screaming anxiety of feeling like I was suffocating for days. 

Ever run so hard and so long that you cannot draw a breath? You've got a stitch in your side, your lungs are screaming for air, and it physically hurts? Now multiply that times ten, strap some iron bands around your chest so you can't draw a full breath, and breath through a straw, and do it for a full week without sleep and without much food. Eating makes the breathlessness worse because of the effort and because food in your stomach reduces your ability to breath.

&gt; SINGAPORE: Health Minister Gan Kim Yong has instructed that a correction direction be issued to Mr Alex Tan, the owner of the States Times Review (STR) Facebook page, said the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA) Office on Friday (Feb 14).

&gt; He also ordered that a targeted correction direction be issued to Facebook, which hosted the Feb 13 post by STR that is said to contain ""multiple false statements"" about the COVID-19 situation.

&gt; STR's correction direction requires it to carry a correction notice alongside the article, while Facebook's targeted correction direction requires it to publish a correction notice on the relevant STR Facebook post.

&gt; 

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; Facebook had issued a correction notice last year for another STR post, in a first for the platform.

&gt; According to a Factually article on the Gov.sg website, the COVID-19 post claimed five points that were ""entirely false"".

&gt; 

&gt; GOVERNMENT REFUTES CLAIMS

&gt; The post claimed that the Government has been unable to trace the source of infection for any of the infected COVID-19 cases in Singapore.

&gt; The Government refuted this on Factually, saying that as of noon on Feb 13, 51 out of the 58 confirmed cases had been determined to have either recent travel history to mainland China or links with previously announced cases.

&gt; The post claimed the Government is ""the only one"" telling the public not to wear a mask.

&gt; However, MOH's advice specifying there is no need for individuals who are well to wear masks is in line with COVID-19 guidelines by the World Health Organization.

&gt; 

&gt; Health authorities in other countries such as Australia and the United States have also advised that they do not recommend masks to be worn by people who are well, according to the Factually article.

&gt; 

&gt; A third claim made in the post was that ""each China worker"" would get S$100 a day for 14 days of Leave of Absence, fully paid by the Government.

&gt; However, Chinese work pass holders placed on mandatory LOA do not receive the S$100 daily support, said the article. ""It is their employer who would receive the support,"" it said, adding that the Leave of Absence Support Programme covers all workers regardless of nationality.

&gt; 

&gt; The STR post also claimed that Manpower Minister Josephine Teo said she was working hard to bring more workers from China into Singapore.

&gt; ""At no time did (Mrs Teo) say she was working hard to bring more Chinese workers back to Singapore,"" Factually stated.

&gt; ""In fact, the Ministry of Manpower requires employers of work pass holders with travel history to mainland China to obtain prior approval so as to slow down their workers' return to Singapore,"" it added.

&gt; 

&gt; According to Factually, MOM approved about 200 applications daily for planned arrivals between Feb 9 and Feb 12, giving priority to applications in essential services like healthcare, transport and waste management so that operations in these sectors are not compromised.

&gt; Many more applications were rejected, it added.

&gt; Finally, the article claimed that seven countries had banned travel to Singapore when in fact, no countries had done so as of 8pm on Thursday.

&gt; 

&gt; In its statement, the office responsible for the administration of the law under POFMA advised members of the public not to speculate and/or spread falsehoods and rumours.

&gt; ""They should rely on formal Government channels such as the Ministry of Health’s official website and Gov.sg WhatsApp service to get accurate and up-to-date information on the COVID-19 situation in Singapore. Any suspected falsehoods can be reported to info@pofmaoffice.gov.sg.""

As the new Wuhan coronavirus has spread not only all over mainland China, but also worldwide, panic is rising. Inside China there is a growing sense of helplessness, as the government is compelled to take drastic measures to stop the virus, including introducing some travel restrictions in Beijing. I have received panicked queries from journalists and public health workers in China, asking, “How can we protect ourselves and our families?”

The epidemic could have been [controlled fairly easily](https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/24/opinions/wuhan-coronavirus-china-strategy-garrett/index.html) three weeks ago had there been more openness, swift action, and no attempted cover-up. But now it’s too late, and this virus is [spreading globally](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/01/24/wuhan-virus-china-belt-and-road-pandemic/). Because there is no vaccine or treatment for nCoV2019—the Wuhan pneumonia—and infection has spread throughout China, the government is forced to turn to its 2003 SARS playbook. And that means entire cities must be cut off, and the population of the nation must be restricted in its movements and potential disease-spreading behavior. It is not surprising then that travel out of Beijing may be forbidden; the entire mainland could go on lockdown soon.

I know people are very frightened. And I expect panic will rise in the coming days. But very simple measures can protect you.

During the SARS epidemic, I traveled all over China and Hong Kong, interviewed people infected with the virus, doctors and nurses treating the disease, government officials, police—everybody. I was never concerned that I would become infected, despite being in the room with sick individuals. And that’s because I knew what precautions to take. Here are the most important ones to know:

**1. When you leave your home, wear gloves**—winter mittens or outdoor gloves—and keep them on in subways, buses, and public spaces.

**2. If you are in a social situation where you should remove your gloves,** perhaps to shake hands or dine, do not touch your face or eyes, no matter how much something itches. Keep your hands away from contact with your face. And before you put your gloves back on, wash your hands thoroughly with soap and warm water, scrubbing the fingers. Put your gloves on.

**3. Change gloves daily,** washing them thoroughly, and avoid wearing damp gloves.

**4. Masks are useless when worn outdoors and may not be very helpful even indoors.** Most masks deteriorate after one or two wearings. Using the same mask day after day is worse than useless—it’s disgusting, as the contents of your mouth and nose eventually coat the inside of the mask with a smelly veneer that is attractive to bacteria. I rarely wear a face mask in an epidemic, and I have been in more than 30 outbreaks. Instead, I stay away from crowds, and I keep my distance from individual people—a half meter, about 1.5 feet, is a good standard. If someone is coughing or sneezing, I ask them to put on a mask—to protect me from their potentially contaminated fluids. If they decline, I step a meter (about 3 feet) away from them, or I leave. Don’t shake hands or hug people—politely beg off, saying it’s better for both of you not to come in close contact during an epidemic.

**5. Inside your household, remove all of the towels from your bathrooms and kitchen immediately,** and replace them with clean towels that have the names of each family member on them. Instruct everybody in your home to only use their own towels and never touch another family member’s. Wash all towels twice a week. Damp towels provide terrific homes for viruses, like common colds, flus, and, yes, coronaviruses.

**6. Be careful with doorknobs.** If it’s possible to open and close doors using your elbows or shoulders, do so. Wear gloves to turn a doorknob—or wash your hands after touching it. If anybody in your home takes sick, wash your doorknobs regularly. Similarly, be cautious with stairway banisters, desktops, cell phones, toys, laptops—any objects that are hand-held. As long as you handle only your own personal objects, you will be ok—but if you need to pick up someone else’s cell phone or cooking tools or use someone else’s computer keyboard, be mindful of not touching your face and wash your hands immediately after touching the object.

**7. If you share meals, do not use your personal chopsticks and utensils** to remove food from a serving bowl or plate and, of course, tell your children to never drink out of anybody else’s cups or from a container of shared fluid. It is customary in China to prepare several dishes for a meal and then allow everybody at the table to use their personal chopsticks to pull food from the common dishes: Don’t do this until the epidemic is over. Place serving spoons in each dish and instruct everybody at the table to scoop what they want from the serving dishes onto their personal plates or bowls, return the serving spoon to the main dish, and then use their personal chopsticks only to pick food from their personal plate or bowl into their mouth. Wash all food and kitchenware thoroughly between meals and avoid restaurants that have poor hygiene practices.

**8. Absolutely do not buy, slaughter, or consume any live animal** or fish until it is known what species was the source of the virus.

**9. When the weather allows, open your windows** at home or work, letting your space air out. The virus cannot linger in a well-ventilated space. But of course, if it is cold or the weather is inclement, keep warm and close those windows.

**10. Finally, if you are caring for a friend or family member who is running a fever,** always wear a tight-fitting mask when you are near them, and place one on the ailing person (unless they are nauseated). When you replace an old, dirty mask from the face of your friend or loved one be very, very careful—assume, for the sake of your protection, that it is covered in viruses, and handle it while wearing latex gloves, place it inside of a disposable container, seal it, and then put it in the trash. While wearing those latex gloves, gently wash the patient’s face with warm soap and water, using a disposable paper towel or cotton swab, and seal it after use in a container or plastic bag before placing it in your household trash. Wear long-sleeved shirts and clothing that covers your body when you are caring for your ailing friend or relative. Clean everything your patient wears or touches very thoroughly in hot soapy water, including sheets, towels, and utensils. If you have space, isolate the sick person in your household in a room, or a corner of a room, where they are comfortable, but separated from the rest of the household. If the weather is tolerable, open a window that is on the opposite side of the room, so that air gently blows past the patient’s face and then outdoors. Of course, don’t do this if it is very cold, as your friend or loved one will be made sicker if uncomfortably cold.",0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
358,"&gt; I’m just gonna skip this because it’s just you agreeing with me.

No it’s not but fair enough.  

&gt; Ok, herd immunity takes a while 

Oh so I was not agreeing with you.  Well that’s a surprise.  It can take a good while to be honest.  That’s why we have people working on a vaccine at the moment.  

&gt; but it’s disregarding it entirely is rediculous. 

I am disregarding it based on the length of time it takes to kick in and how many people will die before it does.  There is a reason why places like the UK who were talking about this last week are now backing down. 

&gt;  The over 70’s are still at risk of a normal flue so they’re always a risk realistically. 

This is not a normal flu. This is nearer a pneumonia which is why it’s so tough to deal with and it is spreading rapidly unlike the flu which is controlled and there are vaccines which a huge number of people would have taken.  The flu jab, the pneumonia shots for example.  


We don’t have ventilators to help a surge in people which means when weighed up between a person likely to survive or a person less likely to survive such as an elderly person or a person in a risk category, they will choose to save the person most likely to survive.  

The flu is not currently filling up our hospitals and entirely consuming places like China Italy and Spain at a rapid pace.  This is what flattening the curve is all about.  Instead of having 100 people go in on the same day you can take measure to spread those 100 people out over a month or two months.  






 &gt; And the majority of people who go to gyms are in the under 70 bracket. 

Ok this is just dumb.  If you are 30 and you go to the gym.  You pick up covid19 when you are there.  You can now pass it on to the elderly.  That’s why they are asking everyone to stay home and use social distancing.  


&gt; You also clearly don’t understand what herd immunity is. 

Well I know for a fact it is when enough people build up a resistance to a germ or a virus it naturally stops the spread of the disease. For example the Zika virus in Brazil which took 2 years to see herd immunity really come into effect. We can look at 

We know vaccines can help with things like smallpox and polio and they can help create a herd immunity.  

So people should become resistant after they are infected thanks to antibodies that can help here.  The problem is they still don’t know if people can become reinfected with this.  The current rate of spreading with this virus is as quickly as the Spanish flu in 1918.  So about 50% of the population at least will need to be infected before we can build up a herd immunity.  

Here is an interesting video to back that all up.

&gt; Don’t worry, you won’t be seeing a cent 😉. 

There is also the chance your gym may lose enough money before it reopens that it simply won’t reopen. Is everyone going to keep paying membership if the gym is closed for three months for example? 

 &gt; And I agree they’re not gonna open at the end of the month. It’ll be two maybe three. 

Well I hope they have the money to keep it open for three months and I hope people attend when it does reopen.  

&gt;  But a year? Not a chance bud.

Ok, well we will see.  Which gym is it by the way.  I would like to keep an eye.  

&gt; Just one extra thing, just because your post is incredibly long doesn’t make you smart or right. Keep it concise bud

if you don’t have the comprehension to read something that is barely the length of a few text messages you should not really be talking.   I have conveyed my point in the number of words I see as necessary.  

 Given any academic study on this subject is going to hold a lot more words than Reddit allows you better start learning to read some long stuff.

**Martial law would also suspend other freedoms, such as:**


**-  Freedom of Movement**

* Ultimately meaning that you can be locked in a cage for any reason that the newly installed,  military-based government, with its new laws decides. This is quite different than the law we have now, which is decided by free citizens, who are represented by elected officials who will no longer be in power, since the federal government will now control everything, through its military. 

We’ve already had a tiny taste of this unlawful crap with the “shelter in place” order, which quickly became orders to “stay at home”, which immediately set off yet another unconstitutional occurrence through *actual police checkpoints*, and the random stopping and questioning of citizens going about their lives, which the police are absolutely not allowed to do, and for very good reasons that obviously don’t need to be explained to them. This is because they should already be fully aware of these rights , as they are all American citizens - with exactly the same  rights as everyone else, despite popular belief that they are somehow possessing of “more”, or even “different” rights than their fellow citizens, which they absolutely are not. 

But with martial law, remember that we’ll be dealing with soldiers - who are technically *government property*, and basically signed their rights away when they enlisted. They took a solemn, legally binding, oath to the United States, and are required to follow the federal government’s orders, and nothing else, under the very real penalty of high treason. Then they voluntarily allowed them selves to be conditioned (aka “brainwashed”) to do exactly what they’re told *by* that government, and to do it no matter what happens. 

These trained killers are also armed with rifles, tanks, helicopters, aircraft carriers, submarines, missiles, etc. to aid them in carrying out those orders, whatever they may be - and they’ll definitely use them if it somehow becomes “necessary”. 

Of course, wether it’s necessary would be determined by the same government that just stripped us of all our supposedly unalienable rights which once *specifically* protected us from *them*. In other words, we’d be completely fucked... while legally locked in a cage, and probably while being starved and  tortured, as well. It would be the worst thing that could possibly happen to the United States of America, and it’s people. That would mean don’t expect any kind of good to happen, at all, anymore. In other words:

That’s bad.


 **-  The Right of the People  to Practice Free Speech**

* This one is simple: You can no longer say anything that the government doesn’t care for, or they can, and surely will, lock you in a cage, indefinitely. That’s with no chance of a trial, which is done to you legally, and for up to  the rest of your life - if that’s what the government wants to do.  

This new, and massive amount of government power may remind you of the preposterous  “Divine Right of Kings” concept that we spoke of earlier, and it definitely should. That’s not a good thing for us citizens to hear, at all. 

That’s bad. 


**-  Protection from Unreasonable Searches**

* This is exactly what it sounds like. Basically, the cops, and also now the military, can do what they like. This goes all the way up to kicking in your door and taking you to prison, for any reason - no more search warrants, or the requirement of establishing probable cause, to get in the way of “justice”, which, as I mentioned earlier, are formalities which the government hates “dealing” with. 

This is surely the worst thing imaginable for a citizen of a country that is based on the concept of freedom and liberty for all, since once martial law is declared, all of our unalienable rights, that protect us all, will no longer exist. 

Hopefully this will help people to understand why the president keeps referring to this so-called “situation” with COVID-19 as a “war”(which it isn’t) and to himself as a “wartime president”, (which he *definitely* is not) with such frequency. He’s doing this to condition the populace into believing those terrible emergency powers are necessary to grant him, which they most assuredly aren’t. But if there’s one thing any president and his federal government want when so-called “situations” like this arise (where something can be elevated to an unnecessary level of concern so that a panic can then be induced through the media), it’s surely those delicious emergency powers - and apparently, this one wants them at all costs. 

That’s bad. 

**In a nutshell:**

The president keeps saying we’re at war (which isn’t true), so congress can give him way too much power that allows him to use what would be the new, military government, with their own draconian set of laws, to legally do anything to anybody, and all without even the courts, or actual justice, getting in his way.

Hello everyone in the world, I am OOO. I am currently in Hubei region where the Wuhan virus spread to. I am trying to tell the truth right now.

Right now Hubei region and surrounding (?) regions have about 90,000 infected people right now

How much do you know about the Wuhan virus’s contagion/transmission potential (?)

If 1 person is infected, and if you are unable to specifically identify the person who is infected by the Wuhan virus and they are not treated properly, the infected person can at least infect 14 people. So in theory it becomes 14 x 14

Everyone in this region all wants to go home and spend their time with their families and eat dinner together

 All of Italy is now locked.  Bergamo, where Susanne lives, has a hard time.  “I spoke to a friend who works at the hospital here yesterday.  They can no longer handle the amount of patients.  They have to make choices: who to help and who to let die. ""

 That sounds harsh, but that's the situation, says Susanne.  “There are not enough beds, there is not enough ventilation equipment.  And this virus draws to your lungs, so many patients need respiration.  Ambulances drive on and off all day.  Older people are not even picked up anymore.  It is really an absurd situation. ""

 A situation she couldn't have imagined a few weeks ago.  ""It's really unreal.""  Susanne works at Bergamo airport herself, but is now at home.  “We are all obliged to take vacation days.  Because there are so many fewer flights now. ”  Her husband owns a flower shop.  He prefers to sell as much as possible, so that he can also stay at home afterwards.

 Rows for the supermarket
 Many stores are already closed, some are still open.  Susanne herself has ""hoarded"" quite a bit.  “There are long lines in front of the supermarket.  Someone is only allowed in when someone has come out again. ”

 Residents of Bergamo have been told that they should stop their social contacts as much as possible.  “We can't just leave the village anymore.  Then you need a form that states that you need to go to work, for example.  People are also checked whether they have such a form with them. ""  It sounds surreal, but it is necessary, Susanne thinks.  ""It is really a frightening situation.""

 Video lessons
 Her eighteen and fourteen-year-old son and daughter have been at home since last month.  They receive video lessons from school.  Although that does not go smoothly everywhere.  ""They are a bit behind, yes.  But that is not the most important thing now.  My son has to graduate this year.  He wants to study next year at the University of Amsterdam. ""

 In the Netherlands we don't have to let it get as far as in Italy, Susanne thinks.  “But then something has to happen.  I think it is so strange that Rutte does not go further than ""no more shaking hands"".  I thought it was laughable.  Here in Italy all the schools closed after a few days.  And everything just keeps going on with you.  As if you don't realize how serious it is. ”

 Stay at home
 According to Susanne, the call in Brabant to work mainly at home if possible is a good start.  Yet the hair does not really go far enough.  She tries to convince her family in the Netherlands to stay at home.  “My mother in Waalwijk wanted to visit a friend in a hospital in Den Bosch.  Don't, I told her. ""

 It is not her intention to sow panic, Susanne emphasizes.  “I don't want to scare anyone, but I do want to shake people up.  This is no ordinary flu. ”",0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

367,"So you are telling me that Japan has been doing it wrong all this years. IMHO **it is stupid.**

Reasoning bellow, quoting from your link:

&gt;CDC does not recommend that people who are well wear a facemask to protect themselves from respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19.

Ok, provides no reason so far. They could also recommend not to use a helmet as well, then. But let´s continue reading.

&gt;You should only wear a mask if a healthcare professional recommends it. A facemask should be used by people who have COVID-19 and are showing symptoms.

Whatever, how the fuck you know if you have it but not yet presenting any important symptoms? Anyway, you do that once infected to prevent infecting others one would think. Never mind that, let´s just continue.

&gt;This is to protect others from the risk of getting infected

Ok, as per my assessment above. They say explicitly that it DOES WORK to prevent infecting others while you are infected (or not).

Finally,

&gt;The use of facemasks also is crucial for [health workers](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/hcp/infection-control.html) and other [people who are taking care of someone infected with COVID-19 in close settings](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/guidance-home-care.html) (at home or in a health care facility).

So it *DOES help to prevent the infection* from an ill person *or propagating it to healthy people* as per the above. Meaning, it is useful and you should wear one, no?

So that FAQ is absolute **BULLSHIT** or is written by idiots. Unless, the actual reason is that they want to protect the STOCK of the valuable asset, or else, that they are concerned about people not using it properly or throwing it away which on the other hand is not much better than coughing in the middle of people on the public transport. In any event, their explanation is not convincing. Even if they are right.

That is what I think, feel free prove me wrong.",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

For weeks, investors have been pleading for governments to shore up a global economy ravaged by the coronavirus. But after the biggest wave of stimulus announcements since the outbreak began, fear is mounting the efforts might not provide the salvation markets are looking for.

Emergency measures in the UK, Italy and Australia, along with a commitment from Germany's Angela Merkel to do ""whatever is necessary,"" were met with fresh waves of selling in stocks, putting the MSCI All-Country World Index on the brink of a bear market. **The gloom veered toward panic after President Donald Trump announced an underwhelming set of US support measures and restricted travel from Europe.**

More disappointment was to follow, when the European Central Bank left rates unchanged in favour of a temporary expansion of bond purchases. The Stoxx Europe 600 tumbled the most on record while US equities plunged more than 9 per cent, extending losses after a 15-minute NYSE-mandated halt.

While government stimulus helped bring an end to the global recession triggered by the financial crisis, investors are increasingly sceptical whether policymakers can forestall a virus-induced downturn. Fiscal and monetary measures may only help with the knock-on effects of the epidemic's widespread shutdown of economic activity, leaving investors little option but to await the subsiding of the virus itself.

""The central bank 'put' has established a floor under risk assets for the past decade. This is the first time that markets are seriously questioning whether it will work again,"" Jason Daw, a strategist at Societe Generale SA in Singapore, wrote in a note on Thursday.

""While fiscal policy is better medicine than monetary, neither are properly equipped to mitigate the coronavirus-induced growth shock.""

**Error-laden announcements added to Thursday's tumult. Trump's initial comments suggested restrictions on both travel and trade from Europe, while subsequent clarifications emphasised it applied just to people. Even then, the news underscores how steps to slow the spread of the disease unavoidably also hammer businesses, and so corporate earnings and sharemarket valuations.**

Trump spoke little more than an hour after his Australian counterpart, whose own announcements similarly failed to assuage equity investors. Prime Minister Scott Morrison formally announced nearly $18 billion in stimulus. The S&amp;P/ASX 200 Index, which had opened in the red, saw losses more than double at one point before closing 7.4 per cent lower. It is set for similar losses on Friday.

The ECB, for its part, left its deposit facility rate and its main refinancing rate unchanged, while it added $US135 billion ($213 billion) of net asset purchases through the end of 2020. Shares of banks nevertheless extended their drop to 12 per cent.

Stocks extended losses as ECB President Christine Lagarde put the ball in the court of European governments. She urged a coordinated fiscal response and said the virus's implication for inflation is highly uncertain.

Yet the German chancellor's pledge to pull out all stops to contain the economic damage from the virus failed to impress markets. Merkel and her economic team are ready to give up a balanced budget to pay for containment measures, according to people with direct knowledge of the government's economic policy.

The UK's coordination of fiscal and monetary initiatives didn't do much to stem the slide in the nation's stocks either. The Bank of England cut interest rates by half a point on Wednesday, when the UK government also pledged a $US39 billion emergency boost to spending.

One market where authorities are proving purposefully unhelpful is oil. With Saudi Arabia and Russia battling for market share, that's provided a double whammy, alongside the hit due to sliding demand as global growth decelerates.

West Texas Intermediate crude has tumbled by roughly half from the high in January.

Trump's actions might not have prevented a bear market for US stocks, but in another market things have moved in a more favourable direction. The dollar, which Trump has long said was strong and hurting US competitiveness, is on the retreat - at least against the euro and yen. Losses for emerging-market currencies make the dollar index a more equivocal play.

The asset that for the moment stands out as potentially less responsive to fear and panic is gold. The traditional haven asset climbed as the coronavirus spread around the world, but it's come off of the high it reached Monday.",0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0
369,"**2015 White Sox–Orioles crowdless game**

On April 29, 2015, the Baltimore Orioles defeated the Chicago White Sox 8–2 in the first crowdless game ever played by Major League Baseball teams. Due to civil unrest in Baltimore following the death of Freddie Gray, an African-American man who was critically injured while in police custody 10 days earlier, there were insufficient security resources available for the game. The previous two games in the teams' series had been postponed, but the remaining game could neither be moved to another venue on short notice nor made up later in the season, so the decision was made to play the game at Camden Yards without allowing any fans to attend. The scheduled evening start time was also moved up to the afternoon for security reasons.

370,"I think what the West need to understand is that the CCP's primary goal remains consistent. It's to maintain internal perception of power and stability to its own population. This enables CONTROL and COMPLACENCY within China. They can't give 2 fucks what the world thinks. The Western World's response/perception is secondary by a large margin. Our opinions of China poses no real threat to the CCP cause they know they have the world eating from their hands economically. 

So, what is up with all these escalating actions? Well, look internally. People are most unhappy and ready to put blame on the government when they can't put food on the table. The **Wuhan Virus** is preventing people from putting food on the table, and everyone's grandparents/parents are at risk of dying. Furthermore, China's economy was already slowing prior to this cluster-fuck. By shutting down cities, China is going to see a further decline into recession with every passing day. What happens then? People lose business, lose livelihood, lose their quality of life, and all the prosperity that they've enjoyed for the past ~20 years or so. Who do they blame then? The West? Or the CCP for mismanaging the initial outbreak?

* Here comes CCP with the elbow from the top rope! Military exercises in Taiwan! *""LOOK HOW BIG OUR BALLS ARE! CHINA #1!""*

* Using WHO as their propaganda arm! *""THERE'S NO CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE THE VIRUS CAME FROM WUHAN! SEE, THE WEST IS THE BLAME! INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY, AS THEY SAY! DO AS I SAY, NOT AS I DO!""*

* Raise doubts and redirect blame to a nation that had been waging a trade war with you. Scapegoating 101: *""Psh! For all we know, the US Military brought the virus INTO Wuhan. Not our fault. Nah nah!""*

As an outsider seeing these moves, does it anger you? Probably annoys you at the very least. Guess what? The CCP doesn't give a fuck what you think. This is propaganda with a primary aim of quelling doubts and redirecting frustration of their own people. The CCP, at least XJP's version of it, is a half-played Jenga Tower right now. They're desperately trying to find the next block that's safe to remove. The likely outcome is XJP's reign will be toppled by internal rivals. Then the Jenga Tower will be rebuilt. Then we'll copy-pasta this post again in ~20 - 30 years time.

1. Sample
This report describes the characteristics of 1016 patients who died and were COVID-19 positive in Italy. 
(Table : Distribution of case deaths in regions)
2. Demographic data
The average age of deceased patients positive for COVID-19 is 79.4 years (median 80.0, range 38-100, Range
InterQuartile - IQR 75.0-85.8). There are 289 women (28.4%). Figure 1 shows that the median age of the patients
COVID-19 positive deceased is about 15 years higher than that of patients who have contracted
infection (median age: patients deceased 80 years - patients with infection 65 years). Figure 2 shows the
number of deaths by age group. Women who died after becoming infected with COVID-19 have
a higher age than men (median age: women 84 - men 79). Figure 3 shows lethality
(deaths/sicknesses) by age group. As the figure shows, lethality increases markedly after 70
years.
