1,"I'm going to start today's discussion thread with a personal observation and comment about a local high school closing. Lowell High School, the largest HS in SF and and rigorously academic was shut down on Thursday.   
I first heard about it just a few minutes after it was closed. My daughter's (who attends another SF HS) best friend who attends there had facetimed her the news. Our daughter texted us and I didn't believe it, but saw it reported within another 30 minutes. The next morning, in a meeting at our daughter's school (Monthly meeting, but this was specifically about covid-19.  This is what we learned:  
\*a kid goes to the wellness center and tells them their parent tested positive (turns out this was true, one of the two that had at this point.  
\*The school calls the district and the decision was to close the school.  
\*Instead of an orderly closure, the school was evacuated immediately. All 2700 students and 200 or so teachers and staff.  
\*From all accounts, it was anything but orderly.  
\*Most parents were not officially informed about the evacuation until nearly an hour after. Though of course their students were texting and calling them immediately.   
\*Where did many of the student 'evacuate' to? The shopping mall across the street.

If there was a textbook way to NOT respond to a pandemic, this was it.   


Create panic needlessly

Send possibly (though not likely) infected students out into PUBLIC areas.  


I hope they learned.

2,"By announcing the 395 self-quarantined, it paints a picture that maybe it's not so bad being that 5/400 tested positive and 395 tested negative.  More information is clarity, not obscurity. 395 negative tests does not kickstart a panic.  What does is telling us, ""we have 5 tested. No more information to report."" We know there are more people affected and spreading this as we can see around the world in other countries, but we're being told, ""don't worry about it, we're safe. Risk is low""  Also, you can't really put a judgment on the number of tests performed against the number of infected people, when there could be upto 24 days of infectious people without being admitted to a hospital or going to be seen. This is a hidden data point that is causing the infection to spread. The CDC announced in early February they had thousands of tests to send out.  There's no reason why they shouldn't be testing anyone that is suspect of Coronavirus who tests negative for other flu viruses, other than to mask the data.   
Panic, as much as nobody wants, is inevitable. The extremity of that panic will continue building up until the truth comes out. If there are cases growing around the world, people will prioritize as time passes when they want to start preparing. If you release and dump everyone at once, that's what mass hysteria happens. Not everyone will respond to quarantine areas the same way. For example, if they told me there is a quarantine in Miami, FL, and I live in Houston, TX, people here are not going to panic or go crazy and buy everything off the shelves. That just doesn't make sense. But, if the epidemic grows and starts getting closer to Texas, then yes, that anxiety starts growing and people here will start preparing for the enemy coming.

4,"People infected by experience high fever, cough and shortness of breath, as well as fatigue, muscle pain, sore throat, headaches etc... which are exactly the same symptoms as influenza AKA flu. In vast majority of cases those symptoms subside fairly quickly, exactly like in case of flu. And exactly like in case of a flu, they can lead to viral pneumonia.

There are some differences: for example, coronavirus disease tends to have much worse progonosis in elderly (flu is very dangerous in elderly as well, but still less so). However, it seems less dangerous than seasonal flu in children, and about as in healthy adults. Vast majority of deaths from coronavirus disease were people in 60+ bracket, rest had pre-exisitng conditions like diabetes and CVDs (heart and blood vessel diseases), or were immunocompromised.

Oh, and as far as 'cold' goes... common cold is also viral disease, it also has similar symptoms, although usually less severe than flu and includes rhinorrhea, AKA runny nose (it doesn't mean flu can't present wtih runny nose). It too can lead to viral pneumonia.

What helps spread of SARS-CoV-2 is longer time from exposure to onset of symptoms. For flu it's usually about 2-3 days upwards to a week, for coronaviurs it's about 5 days upwards to two weeks. It means there's longer period when person infected has no or very mild symptoms, but already potentially can infect others.

The other aspect not helping out is the fact we're just used to diseases like that: in vast majority of cases unless specifically tested either against antibodies or via PCR even from perspective of medical professional there's no real surefire way of telling if patient has coronavirus disease or any other viral disease presenting with similar symptoms. Reality is we're only 'seeing' it because it's slightly more deadly, but that doesn't mean flu isn't deadly or you can't die from common cold complications either.

So to /u/MarcelineMSU ... if your symptoms are severe obviously seek medical assistance but consider that what you're presenting with is consistent with what you'd also expect from flu or - given 'nose' aspect (runny nose, stuffed nose etc.) more likely just more severe cold. Do not panic, but also don't be an idiot ... and again, that applies not just to coronavirus disease. If you're experience shortness of breath or if symptoms don't subside within couple of days especially seek help.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
5,"&gt;At Philips, major unrest has been caused by the fact that the US seems to be advancing the production of a respiratory equipment plant. The Dutch manufacturer of healthcare equipment fears that Philips Respironics in the American city of Pittsburgh will be brought under the Defense Production Act.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;With this Act of 1950, the time of the Korean War, President Trump can claim production and stocks of respiratory equipment. Philips is thus forced to supply only the American market. Supply to, for example, European countries then becomes impossible.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday that mandates his Health Minister Alex Azar to use the law or parts of it. Trump said to do so reluctantly, because he would be averse to government intervention in the economy. ""We don't like nationalization,"" the president said at his daily press conference on Sunday. ""Call Venezuela and see how that worked out there.""  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;But under pressure, especially from Democrats in the House of Representatives, who are worried about acute shortages of respirators in American Covid-19 fireplaces, such as New York, Trump went over. The law hasn't been used yet, ""but as soon as it's needed, it will be used,"" Trump said.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;""We're very concerned,"" said Philip's spokesman Steve Klink. Trump will hold a press conference this Monday (six o'clock tonight Dutch time). ""We're anxiously awaiting it.""  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Trade dispute  
&gt;  
&gt;In other parts of Europe, too, manufacturers of respirators fear the consequences of invoking the law. They point out that this could lead to an international trade conflict affecting corona patients.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Manufacturers of respirators depend on parts from all over the world - even Philips in Pittsburgh cannot do without parts made in Europe. In order to put pressure on the Americans, European companies may cease supply. No one wants that scenario, say those involved.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Philips 'does not want to speculate yet' about the consequences of an American claim. Klink: ""We're just doing what's needed now: increasing capacity.""  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Philips in Pittsburgh is now in the process of hiring an additional 50 employees. It wants to double the production of respirators in the next eight weeks - from a thousand to two thousand a week. ""And after those two months we want to double it again,"" says Klink. ""To do that we depend on our network of suppliers. We're all fighting the same clock."" If one country, such as the United States, creates a barrier,"" says Klink, ""the global production and supply of respiratory equipment runs aground.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;According to the Independent American Medical Regulator Emergency Care Research Institute (ECRI), half of the ventilation equipment in American hospitals is produced by non-US companies. The experts warn that the city of New York alone will be short of more than 15,000 devices if the coronary pandemic reaches its calculated peak. To increase production, everyone in the world is dependent on each other, says ECRI director Marcus Schabacker in The New York Times. ""Whether you like it or not, every respirator maker in the world is looking for parts, and they all come from the same suppliers. Many of those suppliers are European and Asian.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Direct contact  
&gt;  
&gt;Philips-director Frans van Houten consulted with ""the most important competitors"" by telephone last weekend, says Philips-spokesman Klink. ""To discuss how we can scale up together. And then there's the question: are we going to be on time?""  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Trumps claims law ""goes against how Philips views fair policy,"" says Klink. Philips is in direct contact with the U.S. government and U.S. health officials, trying to stop the law being invoked and ""convince them of the importance of cooperation and of open borders for production and supply,"" says Klink.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Does Philips have a plan B? ""Quickly in the Netherlands, as a stopgap solution, starting up the production of respirators is unfeasible.""  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;In Europe, too, countries are trying to get a better grip on scarce supplies of medical supplies. For example, Germany announced a ban on the export of mouth masks, and the French government took control of the production of masks by manufacturers.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The Netherlands has a variant on the American Defense Production Act, the Claims Act. Last week, SP and GroenLinks insisted on setting in motion a Claims Order that would allow the government to seize (medical) stocks of companies in extreme cases. On Sunday, the cabinet decided not to do so because it would ""deter foreign suppliers who supply to the Netherlands"".

6,"I'm not worried about COVID-19 for the same reason I'm not worried about catching the flu. There are people - namely the very young, the elderly, and those with pre-existing conditions - that are in danger of fatal symptoms, but I'm not one of them. Those same people are (or at least should be) also worried about the common flu, but that doesnt mean I have to be worried about the common flu on their behalf.

Of course, even though I'm not worried about the common flu I stay clean and virus-free because that's what decent humans do. And in doing so I not only protect myself from the flu, but those who are in more danger from it than I am. Same goes for COVID-19.

The thing that sets COVID-19 aside is the fact that unlike most other flus it has some extra things going for it...
- We know little about it
- It is highly contagious
- Its symptoms are delayed
- Unlike the common flu, we dont have a cure. This puts the aforementioned people groups at even greater risk of death.

For these reasons we need to be hyper-cautious of it, if not for ourselves then to protect those who are in mortal danger. Hyper-cautious, but not worried. 

Ultimately if you're clean, healthy, and listen to the advice of professionals (**I.e, not me**) then you have very little to be worried about.

7,"**32 donation stations across the country**

“1 recovered, 6 have improved, 3 improved and in stable condition” Explains Zhou Min, Chief of Respiratory Department at Ruijin Hospital, regarding the initial batch of 10 patients trialled.
Since 08/02/2020, under the support of Ministry of Science and Technology, China National Biotec Group Company Limited began the trial program in corporation with Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan Jiangxia First People's Hospital and Wuhan Jiangxia District Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital. Ruijin Hospital supported by perform the data analysis and summery.

The Vice Director of Wuhan Jiangxia First People's Hospital and the father of this plasma immunotherapy program, Dr Liu Ben De have been suggesting the idea since 20/01/2020. At the time, faced with hundreds of suspected and confirmed patients as well as the high CFR of COVID-19, he considered the idea was worth a try as a treatment of last resort. Thus Jiangxia District became a test bed. On 05/02/2020, led by Party Secretary of Jiangxia District Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital Zong Jian, 20 recovered medical staff donated a total of 6000mL of blood plasma. In the week starting 08/02/2020, these were deployed into the initial trial program of 10 patients.

“Most patients show different levels of improvement within 2-3 days. After treatment their C-reactive protein, liver function, blood oxygen all saw improvements. Peripheral blood lymphocyte count increased, CT imagery showed significant reabsorption of pneumonia fluid, all patients where showing negative for virus in their blood plasma within a week.” Explains Zhou Min.
The first clean sign of positive clinical result brought a ray of hope to the many suffers of COVID-19. On 13/02/2020, Director of Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital Zhang Ding Yu unveiled the progress of the plasma immunotherapy program to the nation and called upon recovered patients to donate blood plasma. And thus plasma immunotherapy came into the view of the public. 16/02/2020, China National Biotec Group opened their Shandong donation station and welcomes the first donor from outside Wuhan. Soon after many more provinces and cities joined in the plasma immunotherapy program.

As of 28/02/2020, China National Biotec Group has opened 32 donation stations for recovered COVID-19 patients. Other than Hubei itself, the stations are now available across 15 provinces and cities, from Shandong to Sichuan to Gansu to Beijing to Hebei to Hainan to Jiangnan to Shanghai and more. There are now 28 provinces and cities which have accepted plasma donation, and 16 provinces and cities have treated patients with plasma immunotherapy, with recoveries seen so far in three of those 16.

Overall, despite lacking double blind clinical trial, plasma immunotherapy has proven its value. On 27/02/2020, Lancet published an article from Chongqing Medical University. Per the article, lacking any serious risk convalescent blood plasma is deemed to be acceptable for treatment. And more research into safety and effectiveness of plasma immunotherapy to treat COVID-19 is called for.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

Unfortunately that is ***one*** (very extreme) case of ***one specific continent*** being 50% infected ***hundreds*** of years ago, back when medical care was 1000x worse, and quarantines were non-existent. That is *not* proof of coronavirus being likely to infect half of the ***entire world*** (note how the entire world has 7 continents, not one). The fact is is that I could probably list a bunch of different viruses that were new and didn't infect anywhere near half the population. In fact, that list would actually be every single pandemic ever, because a pandemic is an outbreak of a new virus, and there have likely been tens of thousands of them over the past 1000 years.

The fact is, thus far you have said that coronavirus is ***guaranteed*** to infect ***half the population of the planet***. The only evidence you have presented is that, because it is new, that means it will infect half the population, despite the fact that there have been ***literally thousands*** of new viruses that have not done that. 

I then asked you to provide proof that it will infect half of the population (again), and the only evidence you provided were two instances of new viruses infecting people. ***Neither of them*** infected half the population of the world, which is what you say coronavirus is guaranteed to do (you also notably left out the thousands of new viruses that didn't infect half of the population, which is to say all of them). The fact is that, again, the rate of viruses doing what you claim that coronavirus has an ***100% chance of doing*** is basically ***0%***. 

The fact is, it does not seem like you have evidence that coronavirus has ***any chanc****e* of infecting half the population, much less an ***100%*** chance. I would suggest you either find some, or delete your main post altogether, because as of now it looks to be completely false, and therefore misleading.",1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
9,"&gt; # Columbariums adopt safety measures for upcoming Qing Ming Festival

&gt; For the first time in 99 years, the air-conditioned columbarium and ancestral tablet halls in Kong Meng San Phor Kark See Monastery in Bright Hill Road near Upper Thomson is closed to the public for the upcoming Qing Ming Festival.

&gt; The monastery said in a Facebook post yesterday that all Qing Ming ancestral prayers for the public will be moved to its multi-storey carpark on level 1 and the open-air tentage next to it.

&gt; The Qing Ming Festival takes place on April 4, with crowds also expected on April 10 - the Good Friday public holiday - as well as on the weekends between this Saturday and April 19.

&gt; The immediate shutdown is in line with the Government's push for social distancing during the Covid-19 crisis, the monastery said. It will also cease distribution of free food.

&gt; Those who want to participate in the ""Dedication of Merits to the Departed"" ritual can follow a live screening on its Facebook page, it added. All prayer offerings, which can be purchased online, will be donated to charity homes after the prayer.

&gt; Nirvana Memorial Garden in Old Choa Chu Kang Road is also encouraging its customers to participate in its ""pray on behalf service package"", which allows the centre to dedicate offerings on their behalf.

&gt; Photos of the prayer session will be sent to the family members within three days of the service completion.

&gt; While the air-conditioned columbarium will still be open to the public, all prayers for Qing Ming will be held outdoors.

&gt; The number of people allowed inside each compartment indoors will be limited to 10, a staff member told Chinese evening daily Lianhe Wanbao.

&gt; Temperatures will be taken and visitors must complete a health declaration form.

&gt; It will be business as usual at the open-air Kwong Wai Siew Peck San Theng columbarium in Bishan.

&gt; Its general manager, Mr Liu Khee Fang, told Wanbao it is unnecessary to close because of how the blocks are situated.

&gt; But precautionary measures such as temperature taking will be in place. The columbarium will also restrict the total number of visitors to no more than 250 at any one time.

&gt; Visitors can drop off their offerings and its staff will burn them after the doors are closed.

10,"aiight friendo, hold on to your butt. Here's the full breakdown.

Do you remember the COVFEFE tweet? This was often considered a typo. But it wasn't. It was signal. It was the beginning of the end. Start at the beginning.
Obviously, the COV- covid. COrona Virus. It's right there. It's missing the covID-19, but the initial shortened name of this pandemic causing pathogen was 2019 Novel Corona Virus. So we're not lookin for ID-19 to finish the name covid-19, we're looking for 2019.

This can be found by decoding the remainder of the word covfefe. FEFE- the numbers in the alphabet are 6565. We were in the third year of the 45th president's reign when it started. So you divide 6565 by 345. This gives you 19.02. Which means 2019. The 02 stands for two months after 2019, or February 2020, which is when covid-19 became highly relevant to the United States of America (god bless).

This has been planned for a long, long time. But why, you might ask. The protests in Hong Kong? Eugenics? Toilet paper stock investors? The slow implementation of martial law and tighter restrictions on our freedom? Biological assassination of the Pope, in Rome, in Italy, one of the hardest hit places with an alarmingly high death rate?

No. This is deeper than that. This is the time of the Beast. I direct your attention to Revelation 3:15-18- ""And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name. Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six"". The verse begins with NO MAN MIGHT BUY OR SELL, and ends with the number of the beast.

Six continents have been infected. What does the word 'sick' sound a lot like? Six. Sicks. And everyone is standing 6 feet apart for 'social distancing'. Six continents of sicks standing six feet apart.

11,"Extract:

In the most scripted of presidential settings, a prime-time televised address to the nation, President Trump decided to ad-lib — and his errors triggered a market meltdown, panicked travelers overseas and crystallized for his critics just how dangerously he has fumbled his management of the coronavirus.

Even Trump — a man practically allergic to admitting mistakes — knew he’d screwed up by declaring Wednesday night that his ban on travel from Europe would include cargo and trade, and acknowledged as much to aides in the Oval Office as soon as he’d finished speaking, according to one senior administration official and a second person, both with knowledge of the episode.

Jared Kushner, his son-in-law and senior adviser who has seized control over some aspects of the government’s coronavirus response, reassured Trump that aides would correct his misstatement, four administration officials said, and they scrambled to do just that. The president also told staffers to make sure other countries did not believe trade would be affected, and even sent a cleanup tweet of his own: “The restriction stops people not goods,” he wrote.

Other administration officials rushed to alert the public that U.S. citizens would be exempt from the travel ban, after scores of Americans, upon digesting Trump’s speech, phoned government offices and raced to airports in Europe out of concern that they would not be able to fly home.

Trump’s 10-minute Oval Office address Wednesday night reflected not only his handling of the coronavirus crisis but, in some ways, much of his presidency. It was riddled with errors, nationalist and xenophobic in tone, limited in its empathy, and boastful of both his own decisions and the supremacy of the nation he leads.

Futures for the Dow Jones industrial average fell in real time with virtually each word Trump uttered, signaling a lack of confidence among investors that he had control of the crisis and previewing another bloodbath once the markets opened Thursday morning.

Trump — who believed that by giving the speech he would appear in command and that his remarks would reassure financial markets and the country — was in “an unusually foul mood” and sounded at times “apoplectic” on Thursday as he watched stocks tumble and digested widespread criticism of his speech, according to a former senior administration official briefed on his private conversations.
This official, like many others interviewed for this story, spoke on the condition of anonymity to share sensitive information or make candid assessments.

Ben Rhodes, a senior White House aide who helped former president Barack Obama script and manage his responses to numerous crises, predicted that Wednesday night’s address will stand as “the moment people associate with the fact that Donald Trump failed the biggest test of his presidency.”

I think we’ll look back on this as a defining moment of the Trump presidency because it speaks to larger concerns that people already had about Trump — that he can’t tell the truth, that he doesn’t value expertise, that he doesn’t take the presidency seriously enough,” Rhodes said.

As often is the case after Trump gives a major speech, his Republican allies offered a chorus of praise on television and social media for his “fantastic speech” and “decisive actions” and “unique strength.”

Inside the White House, however, aides and advisers privately acknowledged that Trump failed to accomplish the primary goal of his speech — reassuring the nation — and described it as disappointing and far from his best performance.

Trump’s speech contained at least two errors and a significant omission. He said the travel ban would apply to cargo; it did not. He said health insurance companies would waive patients’ co-payments for coronavirus testing and treatment; industry officials later clarified that they would waive payments for testing only. And he did not fully explain the details of his travel restrictions, leaving out the fact that U.S. citizens would be exempt.

The president’s remarks were devoid of much substantive information on other matters. Trump provided no update for citizens on the spread of the virus, nor on the availability and results of testing.

Public health experts have said testing citizens for the coronavirus is essential for identifying new cases and limiting its spread, but the nation has experienced a chronic shortage of test kits after weeks of missteps by the government. Trump devoted only two short sentences to the topic, and they were vague: “Testing and testing capabilities are expanding rapidly, day by day. We are moving very quickly.”

Stylistically, the president himself seemed ill at ease in the formal setting, offering a monotone and labored delivery from behind the Resolute Desk, twiddling his thumbs and even, in moments, struggling to read words on the teleprompter. One senior administration official said Trump’s heart was not in the speech.

“It was jolting,” said Julian Zelizer, a presidential historian at Princeton University. “People are naturally scared. People want to see a leader who has a commanding presence. In some ways, the country is worse off after a message like that.”

The speech itself was rushed. After weeks of playing down the coronavirus’s threat to the United States, Trump was reluctant to appreciate the full scope of the crisis on his hands. But with the markets in free fall, he decided early Wednesday that he wanted to give the televised speech that night, administration officials said. This startled some of his aides and set off a frantic scramble to arrange airtime on television networks, iron out logistics for his delivery and prepare a draft of what he would say, the officials said.

“This was a real missed opportunity to not just have a couple of sentences in there about how other people need to put partisanship aside and come together, but to really show it,” the former senior administration official said, noting that Trump could have sought to rise above the politics of the moment to convey a sense of unity and common purpose.

“The speech almost writes itself in a way,” this person added. “It can be kind of formulaic. It’s not rocket science.”

The speech was largely written by Kushner and senior policy adviser Stephen Miller, who were still making tweaks to the text until moments before Trump delivered it, according to people familiar with the process. Thirty minutes before Trump appeared live on camera, a final draft of his remarks still had not circulated widely within the White House, one of those people said. And senior health experts in the administration did not review a final draft of the remarks, according to a senior administration official.

While Kushner and Miller crafted the remarks, a coterie of other officials were involved in the process and joined Trump in the Oval Office to watch his delivery. One person with knowledge of the speech said they included Vice President Pence, Ivanka Trump, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, and a sizable group of White House aides: Christopher Liddell, Eric Ueland, Dan Scavino, Hogan Gidley, Judd Deere, John McEntee, Anthony Ornato and Nick Luna.

Some officials faulted the rushed timeline for the messy speech, which they said could have been delivered even sooner, as it became clear the virus was well on its way to becoming a global pandemic — a designation the World Health Organization officially bestowed upon the coronavirus Wednesday.

“Everyone usually gets [Trump] where he needs to be within a couple of days,” one official said. “The problem is we don’t have a couple of days.”

Kushner only recently became involved with the administration’s virus response, beginning to attend meetings in his capacity as a senior adviser, according to officials, but inserted himself more fully as he became increasingly convinced that more tangible action was needed. He supported Trump’s decision to ban most travel from Europe for 30 days and has pushed for further concrete steps, some of which are expected to be announced in the coming days, officials said.

There was some frustration among other White House aides at the sudden involvement by Kushner, who they viewed as simply parachuting in and whose vast portfolio — including Middle East peace negotiations, immigration and the reelection campaign — has been the subject of mockery in some circles.

The travel ban has been criticized by some experts for being largely ineffectual at this point considering the virus already has spread throughout the United States, as well as the fact that Trump exempted the United Kingdom, meaning anyone trying to fly to America from Europe could simply get to London first.

Tom Bossert, Trump’s former homeland security adviser, was sharply critical of the measure, saying it would have been helpful earlier but now the key focus should be on community mitigation, such as closing schools or quarantining sick individuals.

“There’s little value to European travel restrictions,” Bossert tweeted Thursday morning. “Poor use of time &amp; energy.”

On NBC’s “Today” show Thursday morning, host Savannah Guthrie read Pence — who is overseeing the administration’s coronavirus response — a snippet of a Trump tweet in which the president accused “the Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party” of trying to “inflame the CoronaVirus situation.”

“There’s been some irresponsible rhetoric,” the vice president told Guthrie, before going on to praise Trump for his concern for the health and well-being of the American public.

It was initially unclear if Pence was perhaps criticizing his boss for the president’s own “irresponsible rhetoric.” But when asked, an aide to the vice president quickly insisted that he was not.",1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0

13,"&gt;The nation’s economy stalled in the final three months of 2019 to its slowest rate of growth since 2016, Statistics Canada is expected to report on Friday. Previous **hopes for a quick rebound in 2020 are fading as new coronavirus infections and death counts continue to climb with no end in sight.**

****

&gt;Concerns around **the outbreak caused financial markets to plummet this week and there are now two rate cuts fully priced in for the Bank of Canada over the next 12 months**. 

****

&gt;The central bank has stood pat over the past year and bucked the global easing trend, but it **may not be able to hold off for much longer if the epidemic shows real spillover effects on the domestic economy.**

****

&gt;“If they see signs that the concerns over the virus are actually hitting activity broadly, I think that would be enough” to cut, Bank of Montreal Chief Economist Doug Porter said in an interview in Toronto. “There’s a debate now if they could go as early as next week,” he said, referring the **Bank of Canada’s March 4 rate decision.**

****

&gt;...**Economists and policy makers are keeping a close eye on how coronavirus might affect Canada.** Already, some of the country’s **major companies are taking action in anticipation of the deteriorating outlook.** Teck Resources said last week it will be **temporarily reducing coal production partly due to the potential for weaker demand from the coronavirus.**

****

&gt;During the last quarter of 2019, **Canada’s economy slowed to a 0.3% annualized pace, according to the median forecast of economists in a Bloomberg survey.** 

&gt;A series of temporary factors during the period hampered the economy, including **a week-long rail strike, a pipeline leak, and manufacturing plant shutdowns.**

****

&gt;The Bank of Canada had **already cut its forecast for the fourth quarter to 0.3% annualized**. Any deviation from that figure will probably **inform discussions at next week’s meeting of policy makers in Ottawa.**

****

&gt;Most economists were expecting growth to quickly recover to a modest pace in the first quarter but now even **those forecasts are being cut as the virus outbreak and another rail disruption are poised to stunt growth**. 

****

&gt;The central bank **estimated in January growth would jump to 1.3% in the first three months of 2020 before accelerating later in the year.**

****

&gt;A worsening **virus outbreak is the biggest downside risk to Canada’s economy**, Porter said, adding that **BMO cut its 2020 GDP forecast for Canada a few weeks ago due to the direct impact from a slowdown in China.** The bank will be watching for further disruptions **as the virus outbreak impinges on supply chains globally.**

****

&gt;For all of 2019, **the economy is expected to record growth of 1.6%, down from 2% in 2018 and 3.2% in 2017**. For this year, **economists predict growth will tick lower to about 1.5%, but those forecasts were made earlier this month, before the rail blockades and coronavirus threat escalated.**",0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

OTHER CONCERNS:   


It seems the severe patients be less due to cytokine storm specifically, and more to do with COVID-19 interacting with the nervous system, screwing up communication between brain and lungs:   
""Like other respiratory viruses,

SARS-COV-2 may enter the CNS through the hematogenous or retrograde neuronal

route. The latter can be supported by the fact that some patients in this study had

hyposmia. We also found that the lymphocyte counts were lower for patients with

CNS symptoms than without CNS symptoms. This phenomenon may be indicative of

the immunosuppression in COVID-19 patients with CNS symptoms, especially in the

severe subgroup. Moreover, we found severe patients had higher D-dimer levels than

that of non-severe patients. This may be the reason why severe patients are more

likely to develop cerebrovascular disease.

16,"PARIS: I've put the kids in the freezer, so everything's cool now.""

Parents may be joking on social media about their childcare hell as more and more countries go into lockdown with the coronavirus.

But child protection professionals are not laughing.
They have real worries about the risks with families locked up 24/7 together for an indefinite period.

""You will no doubt want to throw your children out the window at some point. That's normal,"" psychologist Moira Mikolajczak told AFP.

""What isn't normal, is to do that,"" she warned, as she urged parents to give themselves a break and ""not try to be Superman or Superwoman"".

While governments across Europe from Ireland to Greece have been having schools send lessons and activity ideas by email to occupy bored children, social media is full of testimony from parents frazzled at having to be both teacher and playmate to their kids.

Grassroots groups, however, are trying to step into the gap with the French feminist collective #NousToutes (""All of Us""), which campaigns against domestic violence, mobilising with WhatsApp support groups and practical tips on how ""not to blow your top"".

""Being locked down gives us the chance to spend lots and lots of time with our children,"" the group said, tongue ever so slightly in cheek.

But when ""we have to work from home and we are all stuck together in a small space, tensions can escalate”.

‘Step away!'

Its WhatsApp groups already have 4,000 members dispensing support and tips on how to stay zen.

First among them is ""step away when you feel the tension mount (even if that means locking the toilet door)"".

Parents should also watch funny videos with their children, ""and program in 'off' times when you can be on your own... while someone else looks after the children"".

The main thing is to try to avoid ""words or gestures... that can hurt and wound... because we can behave in ways that we will regret immediately"".

Mother-of-three Sarah, whose kids range in age from seven to just two months, is ""staying relaxed"" so far.

""Yesterday I took an hour for myself in my room, without a child hanging from me, and I did a meditation session via Instagram,"" the Parisian told AFP.

""It's going OK, but it's worrying for the long haul,"" she said as France neared the end of its first week in total lockdown.

If it is tough for the parents, it's no walk in the park for the children either — they too have been ordered home across large swathes of Europe and now in parts of the US.

""When we got into the living room when Mummy is working, there can be arguments,"" said 10-year-old Estheban.

""I am having to be a mother, a teacher, a cook, a cleaner and do my job as an executive in a bank from home at the same time,"" said Virginie, who has two sons aged 11 and six.

While most parents will cope, said Mikolajczak, Professor of Emotion and Health Psychology at the University of Louvain in Belgium, some will not.

""We can predict increases in parental burnout,"" she said, and sometimes there could even be ""neglect and violence"".

'Relax the rules'

Governments have the same worry, with the French children's ministry warning of a ""higher risk of mistreatment... and since it will be happening at home, it will be hard to spot”.

""Stay at home parents are more vulnerable to burnout,"" Mikolajczak said, an effect likely to be exacerbated by the fact they are there against their will.

""Western families are also not used to living on top of each other,"" she added.

Added to which families can no longer turn ""to grandparents for help nor go out"" somewhere to blow off steam.

Mikolajczak said structuring the children's day can really help with moments when they will play or work on their own.

And she urged parents to ""be flexible and not afraid to relax some rules"".

""Let it go,"" said Etienne, the father of two girls aged 10 and six, who has adopted the refrain from Disney's film Frozen to get him through the crisis.

In these exceptional times you cannot juggle everything, he said.

""At the beginning when the schools closed, I put myself under pressure. I didn't know what to do. I had no time for myself nor the kids.

""Then the penny dropped. I stopped working and since then it's going a lot better,"" he said. — AFP",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0

1. A frontline doctor’s general description of symptoms for the Covid’s first three weeks of illness.

2. A day by day description of symptoms (from day 1 through day 12) and treatment for the first patient in the USA. He began feeling ill on Jan. 15, was admitted to the hospital on Jan. 20th, and was released from the hospital Feb. 3rd/4.

Symptoms explained by Doctor ihttps://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/reporters-notebook-life-and-death-in-a-wuhan-coronavirus-icu: 

“I've observed that the breakout period of the novel coronavirus tends to be three weeks, from the onset of symptoms to developing difficulties breathing. Basically going from mild to severe symptoms takes about a week. There are all sorts of mild symptoms: feebleness, shortness of breath, some people have fevers, some don't. Based on studies of our 138 cases, the most common symptoms in the first stage are fever (98.6 per cent of cases), feebleness (69.6 per cent), cough (59.4 per cent), muscle pains (34.8 per cent), difficulties breathing (31.2%), while less common symptoms include headaches, dizziness, stomach pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting.

But some patients who enter the second week will suddenly get worse. At this stage, people should go to the hospital. The elderly with underlying conditions may develop complications; some may need machine-assisted respiration. When the body's other organs start to fail, that's when it becomes severe, while those with strong immune systems see their symptoms decrease in severity at this stage and gradually recover. So the second week is what determines whether the illness becomes critical.

The third week determines whether critical illness leads to death. Some in critical condition who receive treatment can raise their level of lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell, and see an improvement in their immune systems, and have been brought back, so to speak. But those whose lymphocyte numbers continue to decline, those whose immune systems are destroyed in the end, experience multiple organ failure and die.

For most, the illness is over in two weeks, whereas for those for whom the illness becomes severe, if they can survive three weeks, they're good. Those that can't will die in three weeks.”

Symptom Progression Day 1 to Day 12 From
First Case of 2019 Novel Coronavirus in the United States 

35 year old male

https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001191

On January 19, 2020, a 35-year-old man presented to an urgent care clinic in Snohomish County, Washington, with a 4-day history of cough and subjective fever. On checking into the clinic, the patient put on a mask in the waiting room. After waiting approximately 20 minutes, he was taken into an examination room and underwent evaluation by a provider. He disclosed that he had returned to Washington State on January 15 after traveling to visit family in Wuhan, China. The patient stated that he had seen a health alert from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) about the novel coronavirus outbreak in China and, because of his symptoms and recent travel, decided to see a health care provider....

Given the patient’s travel history, the local and state health departments were immediately notified. Together with the urgent care clinician, the Washington Department of Health notified the CDC Emergency Operations Center. Although the patient reported that he had not spent time at the Huanan seafood market and reported no known contact with ill persons during his travel to China, CDC staff concurred with the need to test the patient for 2019-nCoV on the basis of current CDC “persons under investigation” case definitions.8 Specimens were collected in accordance with CDC guidance and included serum and nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens. After specimen collection, the patient was discharged to home isolation with active monitoring by the local health department.
On January 20, 2020, the CDC confirmed that the patient’s nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs tested positive for 2019-nCoV by real-time reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction (rRT-PCR) assay. In coordination with CDC subject-matter experts, state and local health officials, emergency medical services, and hospital leadership and staff, the patient was admitted to an airborne-isolation unit at Providence Regional Medical Center for clinical observation, with health care workers following CDC recommendations for contact, droplet, and airborne precautions with eye protection.

On admission, the patient reported persistent dry cough and a 2-day history of nausea and vomiting; he reported that he had no shortness of breath or chest pain. Vital signs were within normal ranges. On physical examination, the patient was found to have dry mucous membranes. The remainder of the examination was generally unremarkable. After admission, the patient received supportive care, including 2 liters of normal saline and ondansetron for nausea.


On days 2 through 5 of hospitalization (days 6 through 9 of illness), the patient’s vital signs remained largely stable, apart from the development of intermittent fevers accompanied by periods of tachycardia (Figure 2). The patient continued to report a nonproductive cough and appeared fatigued. On the afternoon of hospital day 2, the patient passed a loose bowel movement and reported abdominal discomfort. A second episode of loose stool was reported overnight; a sample of this stool was collected for rRT-PCR testing, along with additional respiratory specimens (nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal) and serum. The stool and both respiratory specimens later tested positive by rRT-PCR for 2019-nCoV, whereas the serum remained negative.

Treatment during this time was largely supportive. For symptom management, the patient received, as needed, antipyretic therapy consisting of 650 mg of acetaminophen every 4 hours and 600 mg of ibuprofen every 6 hours. He also received 600 mg of guaifenesin for his continued cough and approximately 6 liters of normal saline over the first 6 days of hospitalization.


A chest radiograph taken on hospital day 3 (illness day 7) was reported as showing no evidence of infiltrates or abnormalities (Figure 3). However, a second chest radiograph from the night of hospital day 5 (illness day 9) showed evidence of pneumonia in the lower lobe of the left lung (Figure 4). These radiographic findings coincided with a change in respiratory status starting on the evening of hospital day 5, when the patient’s oxygen saturation values as measured by pulse oximetry dropped to as low as 90% while he was breathing ambient air. On day 6, the patient was started on supplemental oxygen, delivered by nasal cannula at 2 liters per minute. Given the changing clinical presentation and concern about hospital-acquired pneumonia, treatment with vancomycin (a 1750-mg loading dose followed by 1 g administered intravenously every 8 hours) and cefepime (administered intravenously every 8 hours) was initiated.


On hospital day 6 (illness day 10), a fourth chest radiograph showed basilar streaky opacities in both lungs, a finding consistent with atypical pneumonia (Figure 5), and rales were noted in both lungs on auscultation. Given the radiographic findings, the decision to administer oxygen supplementation, the patient’s ongoing fevers, the persistent positive 2019-nCoV RNA at multiple sites, and published reports of the development of severe pneumonia3,4 at a period consistent with the development of radiographic pneumonia in this patient, clinicians pursued compassionate use of an investigational antiviral therapy. Treatment with intravenous remdesivir (a novel nucleotide analogue prodrug in development10,11) was initiated on the evening of day 7, and no adverse events were observed in association with the infusion. Vancomycin was discontinued on the evening of day 7, and cefepime was discontinued on the following day, after serial negative procalcitonin levels and negative nasal PCR testing for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

On hospital day 8 (illness day 12), the patient’s clinical condition improved. Supplemental oxygen was discontinued, and his oxygen saturation values improved to 94 to 96% while he was breathing ambient air. The previous bilateral lower-lobe rales were no longer present. His appetite improved, and he was asymptomatic aside from intermittent dry cough and rhinorrhea. 

As of January 30, 2020, the patient remains hospitalized. He is afebrile, and all symptoms have resolved with the exception of his cough, which is decreasing in severity.

What Does the Coronavirus Do to the Body?
Here’s what scientists have learned about how the new virus infects and attacks cells and how it can affect organs beyond the lungs.

As cases of coronavirus infection proliferate around the world and governments take extraordinary measures to limit the spread, there is still a lot of confusion about what exactly the virus does to people’s bodies.
The symptoms — fever, cough, shortness of breath — can signal any number of illnesses, from flu to strep to the common cold. Here is what medical experts and researchers have learned so far about the progression of the infection caused by this new coronavirus — and what they still don’t know.

How does this coronavirus cause infection?
The virus is spread through droplets transmitted into the air from coughing or sneezing, which people nearby can take in through their nose, mouth or eyes. The viral particles in these droplets travel quickly to the back of your nasal passages and to the mucous membranes in the back of your throat, attaching to a particular receptor in cells, beginning there.
Coronavirus particles have spiked proteins sticking out from their surfaces, and these spikes hook onto cell membranes, allowing the virus’s genetic material to enter the human cell.

That genetic material proceeds to “hijack the metabolism of the cell and say, in effect, ‘Don’t do your usual job. Your job now is to help me multiply and make the virus,’” said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville.

How does that process cause respiratory problems?
As copies of the virus multiply, they burst out and infect neighboring cells. The symptoms often start in the back of the throat with a sore throat and a dry cough.

The virus then “crawls progressively down the bronchial tubes,” Dr. Schaffner said. When the virus reaches the lungs, their mucous membranes become inflamed. That can damage the alveoli or lung sacs and they have to work harder to carry out their function of supplying oxygen to the blood that circulates throughout our body and removing carbon dioxide from the blood so that it can be exhaled.

“If you get swelling there, it makes it that much more difficult for oxygen to swim across the mucous membrane,” said Dr. Amy Compton-Phillips, the chief clinical officer for the Providence Health System, which included the hospital in Everett, Wash., that had the first reported case of coronavirus in the United States, in January.

The swelling and the impaired flow of oxygen can cause those areas in the lungs to fill with fluid, pus and dead cells. Pneumonia, an infection in the lung, can occur.

Some people have so much trouble breathing they need to be put on a ventilator. In the worst cases, known as Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, the lungs fill with so much fluid that no amount of breathing support can help, and the patient dies.

What trajectory does the virus take in the lungs?
Dr. Shu-Yuan Xiao, a professor of pathology at the University of Chicago School of Medicine has examined pathology reports on coronavirus patients in China. He said the virus appears to start in peripheral areas on both sides of the lung and can take a while to reach the upper respiratory tract, the trachea and other central airways.

Dr. Xiao, who also serves as the director of the Center For Pathology and Molecular Diagnostics at Wuhan University, said that pattern helps explain why in Wuhan, where the outbreak began, many of the earliest cases were not identified immediately.
The initial testing regimen in many Chinese hospitals did not always detect infection in the peripheral lungs, so some people with symptoms were sent home without treatment.
“They’d either go to other hospitals to seek treatment or stay home and infect their family,” he said. “That’s one of the reasons there was such a wide spread.”

A recent study from a team led by researchers at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai found that more than half of 121 patients in China had normal CT scans early in their disease. That study and work by Dr. Xiao show that as the disease progresses, CT scans show “ground glass opacities,” a kind of hazy veil in parts of the lung that are evident in many types of viral respiratory infections. Those opaque areas can scatter and thicken in places as the illness worsens, creating what radiologists call a “crazy paving” pattern on the scan.

Are the lungs the only part of the body affected?
Not necessarily. Dr. Compton-Phillips said the infection can spread through the mucous membranes, from the nose down to the rectum.
So while the virus appears to zero in on the lungs, it may also be able to infect cells in the gastrointestinal system, experts say. This may be why some patients have symptoms like diarrhea or indigestion. The virus can also get into the bloodstream, Dr. Schaffner said.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that RNA from the new coronavirus has been detected in blood and stool specimens, but that it’s unclear whether infectious virus can persist in blood or stool.
Bone marrow and organs like the liver can become inflamed too, said Dr. George Diaz, section leader for infectious diseases at Providence Regional Medical Center in Everett, Wash., whose team treated the first U.S. coronavirus patient. There may also be some inflammation in small blood vessels, as happened with SARS, the viral outbreak in 2002 and 2003.
“The virus will actually land on organs like the heart, the kidney, the liver, and may cause some direct damage to those organs,” Dr. Schaffner said. As the body’s immune system shifts into high gear to battle the infection, the resulting inflammation may cause those organs to malfunction, he said.
As a result, some patients may endure damage that is inflicted not just by the virus, but by their own immune system as it rages to combat the infection.

Experts have not yet documented whether the virus can affect the brain. But scientists who studied SARS have reported some evidence that the SARS virus could infiltrate the brain in some patients. Given the similarity between SARS and Covid-19, the infection caused by the new coronavirus, a paper published last month in the Journal of Medical Virology argued that the possibility that the new coronavirus might be able to infect some nerve cells should not be ruled out.
Why do some people get very ill but most don’t?
About 80 percent of people infected with the new coronavirus have relatively mild symptoms. But about 20 percent of people become more seriously ill and in about 2 percent of patients in China, which has had the most cases, the disease has been fatal.
Experts say the effects appear to depend on how robust or weakened a person’s immune system is. Older people or those with underlying health issues, like diabetes or another chronic illness, are more likely to develop severe symptoms.
Dr. Xiao conducted pathological examinations of two people in China who went into a hospital in Wuhan in January for a different reason — they needed surgery for early stage lung cancer — but whose records later showed that they had also had coronavirus infection, which the hospital did not recognize at the time. Neither patient’s lung cancer was advanced enough to kill them, he said.

One of those patients, an 84-year-old woman with diabetes, died from pneumonia caused by coronavirus, Dr. Xiao said the records showed.
The other patient, a 73-year-old man, was somewhat healthier, with a history of hypertension that he had managed well for 20 years. Dr. Xiao said the man had successful surgery to remove a lung tumor, was discharged, and nine days later returned to the hospital because he had a fever and cough that was determined to be coronavirus.
Dr. Xiao said that the man had almost certainly been infected during his first stay in the hospital, since other patients in his post-surgical recovery room were later found to have coronavirus. Like many other cases, it took the man days to show respiratory symptoms.
The man recovered after 20 days in the hospital’s infectious disease unit. Experts say that when patients like that recover, it is often because the supportive care — fluids, breathing support, and other treatment — allows them to outlast the worst effects of the inflammation caused by the virus.

What do scientists still not know about coronavirus patients?
A lot. Although the illness resembles SARS in many respects and has elements in common with influenza and pneumonia, the course a patient’s coronavirus will take is not yet fully understood.
Some patients can remain stable for over a week and then suddenly develop pneumonia, Dr. Diaz said. Some patients seem to recover but then develop symptoms again.
Dr. Xiao said that some patients in China recovered but got sick again, apparently because they had damaged and vulnerable lung tissue that was subsequently attacked by bacteria in their body. Some of those patients ended up dying from a bacterial infection, not the virus. But that didn’t appear to cause the majority of deaths, he said.
Other cases have been tragic mysteries. Dr. Xiao said he personally knew a man and woman who got infected, but seemed to be improving. Then the man deteriorated and was hospitalized.

“He was in I.C.U., getting oxygen, and he texted his wife that he was getting better, he had good appetite and so on,” Dr. Xiao said. “But then in the late afternoon, she stopped receiving texts from him. She didn’t know what was going on. And by 10 p.m., she got a notice from the hospital that he had passed.”",0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

- Let's talk about COVID-19. I used to call it ""Corona"". I've heard people calling it ""Chocolate"" (Vietnamese saying it in French ""cho-co-lat""). But it doesn't matter what its name is. We're facing a very dangerous plague.

- Health organizations praised us, saying we've done better than country A, country B, but we have to keep being serious and humble. We are still trying to containing it.

- The main reason was we were very quick and very strict. All the media reported was on what we did after Lunar New Year. **But the fact is we started the measurements since middle December.**

- We didn't have any Lunar New Year. I only remember the New Year Eve as the time we started forced quarantine. It was a very serious measurements that we had to explain to and convince everyone, including WHO because at that time no alert had been raised internationally. We were the first one so it wasn't well-received.

- We had planned and prepared for the virus before the PM's order (16th of Jan).

- The process of thought was simple: plan for the worst scenerios to make sure nothing can get worse.

- We have plans for 5 levels of situation. And I ask for all the journalists here that you do not share nor propagandize the level 5 plans. Those are internally used within the government and medical system.

- Level 4 is a situation where Vietnam has 1,000 infected cases. In reality up to now, we can confidently say we can treat up to 3,000 cases.

- Level 5 is a situation where Vietnam has 30,000 cases. But we will not reveal the plans for this and I sincerely ask that you don't propagandize this. Because it can mislead people and make them think it will happen.

- Anyhow, we have plans for all those scenarios, all those levels. In case any of those happens, a single call will start the procedure and the plans will be executed.

- Because Vietnam has no epicenter yet, I use this ""5 fingers"" system to remind myself:
1. We have to prevent the spread with all our might.
2. We have to detect as quickly as possible
3. We have to quarantine right away.
4. We have to triangulate the potential infected zones
5. We have to cure all the infected and disinfect all the virus once detected.

- I joke that this is like treating a fire. We must pour water on the fire so quick and so effective that the fire is put out before we even here any sizzle.

- We've decided that this is a global issue. We must work with the world. We will do strong methods that we believe will help, but at the same time we talk and convince the world about it too. 

- We've been working on this with China, and now we're working with S.Korea. And Italy, and Iran. We do not know if tomorrow there will be more countries. But we stress that the 5 points I mentioned earlier will not change. We must be determined.

- We know this is an age of information. And in such an age the most important thing is transparency. We've worked with the media to report the most transparent info, not only on the news, but also on social media. The info must be fast and clear.

- Only when the info is fast, clear and true, the people will understand and cooperate to fight against the plague. This fight is not only on the Health Ministry, or the Border Patrol. This fight is on every person in the country too.

- This is the first time the whole People Army of Vietnam was deployed nationally.

- I've known that because of news about how Vietnam has cured 16/16 patients, many regions have started being lax. I have to stress that we cannot drop our guard. We shouldn't be overdramatic, but we definitely must not be overconfident.

&gt; **1. Sample**    
&gt; This report describes the characteristics of 2003 deceased and positive COVID-19 patients in Italy. There
geographical distribution of deaths is as follows:  
  
&gt; **2. Demographics**    
&gt; The average age of deceased and COVID-19 positive patients is 79.5 years (median 80.5, range 31-103, Range
InterQuartile - IQR 74.3-85.9). There are 601 women (30.0%). Figure 1 shows that the median age of the patients
COVID-19 positive deaths is more than 15 years higher than that of patients who contracted
the infection (median age: patients who died 80.5 years - patients with infection 63 years). Figure 2 shows
the number of deaths by age group. Women who died after contracting COVID-19 infection
they are older than men (median ages: women 83.7 - men 79.5).  

&gt; **3. Pre-existing pathologies**    
&gt; Table 1 presents the most common pre-existing chronic pathologies (diagnosed before contracting
infection) in deceased patients. This figure was obtained in 355/2003 deaths (17.7% of the sample
total). The average number of pathologies observed in this population is 2.7 (median 2, Deviation
Standard 1.6). Overall, 3 patients (0.8% of the sample) had 0 pathologies, 8 9 (25.1%)
had 1 pathology, 91 had 2 pathologies (25.6%) and 172 (48.5%) had 3 or more pathologies.
  
&gt; **4. Symptoms**    
&gt; Figure 3 shows the most commonly observed symptoms prior to hospitalization in COVID19 positive deceased patients. As shown in the figure, dyspnea and fever represent the most common symptoms feedback, less common are cough, diarrhea and hemoptysis. 5.2% of people did not present any symptom upon admission.

&gt; **5. Complications**    
&gt; Respiratory failure was the most commonly observed complication in this sample (97.2%
of cases), acute kidney damage (27.8%), followed by acute myocardial damage (10.8%) and superinfection (10.2%)

&gt; **6. Therapies**    
&gt; Figure 4 shows the therapies administered in COVID-19 positive deceased patients during hospitalization. There
Antibiotic therapy was the most widely used (83% of cases), least used antiviral (52%), most
rarely steroid therapy (27%). The common use of antibiotic therapy can be explained by
presence of superinfections or is compatible with initiation of empirical therapy in patients with pneumonia, pending
laboratory confirmation of COVID-19. In 25 cases (14.9%) all 3 therapies were used.

&gt; **7. Times**    
&gt; Figure 5 shows, for COVID-19 positive deceased patients, the median times, in days, that pass
from the onset of symptoms to death (8 days), from the onset of symptoms to hospitalization (4
days) and from hospitalization to death (4 days). The time elapsed from hospitalization to
death was 1 day longer in those who were transferred to resuscitation than those who did not
they were transferred (5 days against 4 days).

&gt; **8. Deaths under the age of 50**    
&gt; To date (17 March), 17 COVID-19 positive patients have died under the age of 50. In particular,
5 of these had fewer than 40 and were all male people aged between 31 and i

27,"Ren Zhiqiang appears to be the latest government critic silenced by the Communist Party as it cracks down on dissent over the epidemic.

By Javier C. Hernández
March 14, 2020, 2:19 p.m. ET
His nickname in China was “The Cannon,” and Ren Zhiqiang’s latest commentary was among his most explosive yet.

Mr. Ren, an outspoken property tycoon in Beijing, wrote in a scathing essay that China’s leader, Xi Jinping, was a power-hungry “clown.” He said the ruling Communist Party’s strict limits on free speech had exacerbated the coronavirus epidemic.

Now Mr. Ren, one of the most prominent critics of Mr. Xi in mainland China, is missing, his friends said on Saturday.

His disappearance comes amid a far-reaching campaign by the party to quash criticism of its slow, secretive initial response to the epidemic, which has killed over 3,100 people in China and sickened more than 80,000.
The Chinese government is working to portray Mr. Xi as a hero who is leading the country to victory in a “people’s war” against the virus. But officials are contending with deep anger from the Chinese public, with many people still seething over the government’s early efforts to conceal the crisis.

Mr. Ren, a party member, is well known for his searing critiques of Mr. Xi. In 2016, the party placed him on a year’s probation for denouncing Mr. Xi’s propaganda policies in comments online.

The government has monitored Mr. Ren’s movements intensely ever since, friends said, preventing him from leaving the country and deleting his social media accounts, where he had built a wide following.

His whereabouts was unclear on Saturday, and the police in Beijing did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

“We’re very worried about him,” said Wang Ying, a retired entrepreneur and friend of Mr. Ren’s. “I will continue to look for him.”
In recent weeks, an essay by Mr. Ren began circulating among elite circles in China and abroad. In it, he blamed the government for silencing whistle-blowers and trying to conceal the outbreak, which began in the central city of Wuhan in December.

While he did not explicitly use Mr. Xi’s name in the commentary, Mr. Ren left no doubt he was speaking about China’s leader, repeatedly referencing Mr. Xi’s speeches and actions.

“I see not an emperor standing there exhibiting his ‘new clothes,’ but a clown who stripped naked and insisted on continuing to be an emperor,” he wrote.
Addressing Mr. Xi, he wrote: “You don’t in the slightest hide your resolute ambition to be an emperor and your determination to destroy anyone who won’t let you.”

Mr. Ren, 69, is the retired chairman of Huayuan Properties, a real estate developer. In 2016, Mr. Ren came under scrutiny after writing on his microblog that China’s news media should serve the people, not the party, contradicting one of Mr. Xi’s high-profile pronouncements. His remarks offered a window into growing frustration among Chinese intellectuals and entrepreneurs over Mr. Xi’s increasingly authoritarian rule.

The party moved quickly to censure him, saying he had “lost his party spirit.” But he continued to speak out on other topics, such as China’s strict policies to limit the population in big cities.
As more details about China’s efforts to cover up the coronavirus outbreak have been disclosed by the Chinese news media in recent weeks, Mr. Xi has come under attack from several prominent Chinese activists and intellectuals.

Xu Zhangrun, a law professor in Beijing, published an essay last month saying that the epidemic had “revealed the rotten core of Chinese governance.”

Xu Zhiyong, a prominent legal activist, released a letter to Mr. Xi on social media, accusing him of a cover-up and calling on him to step down. He was later detained.

Activists said Mr. Ren’s disappearance was a worrying sign that the government was escalating its latest crackdown on free speech.

“The epidemic has brought out the worst of Xi Jinping,” said Yang Jianli, a rights activist based in the United States. “He is so determined not to give an inch, rightly understanding an inch would mean hundreds of miles.”",1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Origin

Amid warnings from public health officials that a 2020 outbreak of a new coronavirus could soon become a pandemic involving the U.S., alarmed readers asked Snopes to verify a rumor that U.S. President Donald Trump had “fired the entire pandemic response team two years ago and then didn’t replace them.”

The claim came from a series of tweetsposted by Judd Legum, who runs Popular Information, a newsletter he describes as being about “politics and power.” Legum’s commentary was representative of sharp criticism from Democratic legislators (and some Republicans) that the Trump administration had ill-prepared the country for a pandemic even as one was looming on the horizon.

Legum outlined a series of cost-cutting decisions made by the Trump administration in preceding years that had gutted the nation’s infectious disease defense infrastructure. The “pandemic response team” firing claim referred to news accounts from Spring 2018 reporting that White House officials tasked with directing a national response to a pandemic had been ousted.

Rear Adm. Timothy Ziemer abruptly departed from his post leading the global health security team on the National Security Council in May 2018 amid a reorganization of the council by then-National Security Advisor John Bolton, and Ziemer’s team was disbanded. Tom Bossert, whom the Washington Post reported “had called for a comprehensive biodefense strategy against pandemics and biological attacks,” had been fired one month prior.

It’s thus true that the Trump administration axed the executive branch team responsible for coordinating a response to a pandemic and did not replace it, eliminating Ziemer’s position and reassigning others, although Bolton was the executive at the top of the National Security Council chain of command at the time.

Legum stated in a follow-up tweet that “Trump also cut funding for the CDC, forcing the CDC to cancel its efforts to help countries prevent infectious-disease threats from becoming epidemics in 39 of 49 countries in 2018.

New data from a joint study looks at the coronavirus’ survivability on different surfaces.

WASHINGTON —

Since the novel coronavirus was first discovered back in December 2019, scientists and health officials have been gauging its ability to survive on different surfaces by comparing it to SARS in 2003.

Both were coronaviruses, so experts believed that they would have similar characteristics. 


A new study by the National Institutes of Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and scientists at Princeton and UCLA is giving the first look at the current virus’s ability to survive on surfaces. The results show that the previous estimations weren’t far off.

FINDINGS
“The scientists found that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was detectable in aerosols for up to three hours, up to four hours on copper, up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel,” A summary by the NIH reads. “The results provide key information about the stability of SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19 disease, and suggests that people may acquire the virus through the air and after touching contaminated objects.”

Scientists tested the virus on five different environments:

Aerosol
Copper
Cardboard
Stainless Steel
Plastic
The main findings represent how long the virus CAN survive, but that doesn’t mean that it always WILL:

Aerosol: Less than 3 hours
Copper: Less than 4 hours
Cardboard: Less than 24 hours
Stainless Steel: Less than 72 hours
Plastic: Less than 72 hours
Officials said the virus’s survivability is impacted by outside factors like temperature and humidity, but the test was conducted in a controlled environment. The temperature was kept between 70-73 degrees and a 40-percent humidity was maintained.

This means that in a perfect lab environment, the virus can survive this long, however in a real-world situation, other factors could lower survivability.

The main takeaway here is that individuals should be cautious of most surfaces right now. People should avoid touching their face and mouth, and as always, keep on washing their hands.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
31,"Evil is the definition for what is and what is not to a liking. 

Meaning:  Is it beneficial? Is it hurting us? Is it a threat? Along with what is considered acts of evil based on our generational experience.  The ocean can be evil because it’s a force to be feared with high fatality rate. When you can swim and have a boat or a ship it’s a means of transportation platform, source of food, source of energy in the life cycle. 

So companies are not “evil”, they’re not to our best interest and us is identified by your self, company, and coexisting dependencies like a tribe or village. 

The extended havoc of a threat is evil because we don’t understand it’s full purpose and contribution to the life cycle, like the grim reaper. The angel of death, the plague or corona virus. 

The question is really why, what, how, for, why and when. 

My point is, everything is good and bad, higher than both in that holy and evil.  The proper question format should be: what contribution compared to damage has been observed?  Example: Company A allows us to live longer, but no reproduce. 

Phrasing is important as it defines who us is.

34,"China’s Communist Party leader, Xi Jinping, issued internal orders about the coronavirus epidemic in early January, about two weeks before his first public remarks on the outbreak, according to a speech by Mr. Xi that was published Saturday. The speech confirmed for the first time that he was aware of the virus while officials at its epicenter were openly downplaying its dangers.

In the speech, Mr. Xi said that he had initially given orders about the coronavirus outbreak on Jan. 7, during a meeting of the Politburo Standing Committee, the Communist Party’s topmost body. That places Mr. Xi’s involvement with fighting the epidemic earlier than previously known. Mr. Xi’s earliest public comment on the epidemic was Jan. 20, when he gave brief instructions on the issue that were published by state media.

In early January, leaders in Wuhan, the city at the epicenter of the outbreak, were giving open assurances that there was no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission. Mr. Xi did not disclose details of his instructions on Jan. 7, but it seems clear that Wuhan officials would have known that the country’s top leader was paying attention to the outbreak.

The evidence that Mr. Xi was addressing the spread of the coronavirus earlier than previously known has now been released apparently in an effort to show that he has commanded the fight against the epidemic — notwithstanding rumors that he let others take the lead.

The speech in which Mr. Xi described his initial involvement in countering the spread of the coronavirus was published by Qiushi, or Seeking Truth, the Communist Party’s top doctrinal journal. Mr. Xi gave the speech on Feb. 3, when the coronavirus was spiraling into a national crisis for China, prompting the lockdown of Wuhan and other hard-hit cities in Hubei Province, and a chain reaction of restrictions across other parts of the country.

Mr. Xi is a dominant figure in Chinese politics, and his utterances are treated as lodestones by officials. Here are some other main points from the newly published Feb. 3 speech:

Mr. Xi in charge: Mr. Xi emphasized that he has been constantly involved in decisions about the crisis, and he indicates that he gave the authorization to put Wuhan and other areas of Hubei under an unprecedented lockdown from Jan. 23. In the speech, Mr. Xi recalled: “I clearly demanded that Hubei Province exercise comprehensive, strict control over the outflow of individuals.”

Two focal points in a nationwide ‘people’s war’: Mr. Xi describes the effort to end the epidemic as an all-encompassing “people’s war” across China. But he singles out two key battlegrounds: Hubei Province, where the infections and deaths have been concentrated, and Beijing, the national capital. “Beijing has a special status,” Mr. Xi told the meeting. He said: “Strengthen management and control of key populations.”

Controlling the narrative: Mr. Xi stresses the importance of preserving social stability through easing public fear, providing adequate supplies of food and other needs, and demonstrating confidence that the epidemic can be beaten. And he also emphasizes winning over public opinion at home and abroad. “There must be closer monitoring and assessment of opinion, proactively speaking out and giving positive guidance,” Mr. Xi said of Chinese public sentiment. “Seize the initiative and effectively shape international opinion,” he added. “Tell well the story of China’s fight against the epidemic.”

Coping with economic damage: Mr. Xi acknowledges that the epidemic and fight to curtail it will drag on China’s economy by putting pressure on industry, especially smaller firms; by slowing construction projects; and by cooling domestic and foreign trade. In response, Mr. Xi said, the government will provide financial support for businesses, help migrant workers return to their jobs when production resumes, and step up support for projects. He also said the blow to consumer spending could be offset by encouraging spending in new areas, such as 5G phone networks, as well as online entertainment and education. He also encouraged areas across China to lower restrictions on car purchases.",0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
35,"Once upon a midnight dream it was revealed that China deliberately engineered Corona Chan as a bioweapon by combining SARS with HIV then set her loose on the Chinese population knowing full well that there would be an acceptable loss of life; acceptable to them since China is known to throw Chinese solider, in mass, at bullets of a battle charge to force the enemy to run out of bullets then come in for the victorious kill (Sun Tzu’s “Art of War”). 

Taking guide from Sun Tzu, top Chinese officials were pre-vaccinated with a dead version of Corona Chan, but not the people, in order for Corona Chan to go Global Pandemic by first locking down major Chinese cities turning those cities into massive viral incubational hot zones.  China also knew they would be the first infected, and thus, the first to recover, while the remainder of the Planet got sick.  Once recovered, the World greatly sick, weak, in a state of rebellious confusion, in desperate need of pharmaceuticals and products, which the remainder of the World could no longer produce due to illness, China, now fully recovered, all factories at 110% production, tries to make her biggest ever business move to cash in on a now very clear and unoccupied market with zero competition free to demand the greatest of prices on all things. But they miscalculated the opposition who discovered the Chinese plan; disputes rage, the nukes fly.

Why do such?  Their economy is fucked.  Mounting debts, with capitalism crushing down, and all around, by way of Hong Kong’s rebellion causing the mainland Chinese people to become displaced and independent thinking in the same manner as Hong Kong. Top Chinese officials, fearing Hong Kong revolt spreading to mainland China, wanted to regain control of their losing power, control of the World, at the same time, and clear off their debts with their largest ever contractual deals; hence, Operation Corona Chan.  They never wanted nukes, just absolute World domination both politically and economically.  They wanted to be the Biggest Dick On The Block; and, like always, China fucked it up.",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
36,"“Give us your huddled masses, yearning to be vaccinated. We’ll find a virus and say a vaccine must be produced.”

One research-estimate suggests there are 320,000 viruses on Earth that infect mammals.

This means: types of viruses. For each type, I suppose you could say there are at least trillions of individual viruses.

So we should all be dead. Long gone. But we aren’t.

First of all, there are what’s called endogenous viruses. They live in the human body and they watch television and they lie around and don’t cause illness. On sophisticated tests, they can show up, and researchers will mistakenly assume they’re doing damage. They’re doing nothing.

Then there are exogenous viruses. They come in from the outside, enter the body, and look for cells in which they can take up residence and multiply. The immune system notices, and either ignores them as trifling or mounts a defense to defeat them. These viruses can also show up on sophisticated tests. Researchers tend to (falsely) believe the mere presence of the viruses signals trouble (illness).

This is a massive mistake. So-called viral infection, if it means anything significant at all, amounts to much more than mere presence. A few particles of virus showing up on a test says nothing about actual illness. There must be millions and millions of a virus actively replicating in the body to cause disease.

And even then, a healthy and strong immune system could ultimately defeat this bunch of little doofuses.

That leaves who knows how many other viruses out there, never living in or entering the human body at all. They’re playing music or their version of baseball or finding warm condos in cows or sheep or moose.

Now we come to what-if type speculations. Suppose dangerous viruses are flying in from planets far away? Suppose they’re combining in caves and then crawling into the bodies of rock climbers? Suppose biowar labs are fiddling and diddling and cooking up altered versions of several viruses that will kill millions of people? CAN YOU PROVE THIS ISN’T SO?

No I can’t, just as I can’t prove that a purple and white snake in the Orion Belt isn’t building a radio.

But I can say this. Doing research on biowar germs isn’t the same thing as doing successful research on them. Assuming these scientists are actually developing biowar germs that work…well, in a recent article titled “People dying equals coronavirus?”, I posted several old dire warnings about past viral epidemics: SARS was weaponized. So was Zika. So was Swine Flu. So was Ebola. And yet…these epidemics were duds.

But you see, the people issuing those dire warnings back then didn’t care, and don’t care now, that their predictions never materialized. They don’t care. Every time a new epidemic is announced by some public health agency, they state brand new warnings.

We humans may routinely be able to fend off and defeat, naturally, 100 trillion trillion viruses in the environment, but this weaponized virus is going to kill us all. Soon.

In the current “coronavirus epic,” there is one new feature the prophets of doom can exploit: after the word comes down that it’s over and done, they can say, “Well, you see, actually more than two million people in China died from the virus. The government there is covering it up. It WAS a bioweapon. PROVE THAT IT WASN’T.”

There is one more category of virus I should mention. I have detailed it in past articles. It’s the virus that isn’t there at all. It’s a beauty. Researchers perform various procedures aimed at detecting it, but these scientists invent MARKERS they CLAIM are indirect evidence of a virus they can’t directly pinpoint. From such lunatic procedures, a whole story and tale and legend about the virus they never found is created. The pros can even report this never-discovered virus is causing a global epidemic. It’s a marvel.

They might go on to develop a vaccine against the never-detected virus. A toxic vaccine.

Or they can say, “All our efforts to produce an effective vaccine against virus X have so far fallen short.” Meaning: “How could we make a vaccine against a virus we never found?”

Just wait a while. Eventually, they’ll figure out a way.

“After, ahem, synthesizing a gene from a specimen of the neuro-electric imprint of the shadow of the recalcitrant cave-hiding virus, we were able to inject the gene in volunteers and reduce the presence of indirect marker CR65-35 by 27.243 percent. We’re confident a vaccine derived from the gene will prove effective in 74.2657843265 percent of healthy individuals. If they get sick, don’t blame us. Blame the virus.

Suspected cases are placed in domestic isolation and are called twice a day by the hygiene services to determine whether symptoms of infection have occurred. If there are even slight signs of illness, a test is carried out.

As of today (Saturday, 7 March, 3 pm), more than 203 people have been placed in domestic isolation and 173 tests have been carried out. Of these, 36 tests were carried out on Friday alone, and an additional 43 are in progress for Saturday.

&gt; Prior to hospital admission, he had gone to work at the construction site. He reported he had mostly stayed at his rental apartment in Campbell Lane since the onset of symptoms.

&gt; CASE 56

&gt; Case 56 is a 30-year-old Bangladesh national who was confirmed to have the COVID-19 infection on Thursday morning.

&gt; He is currently warded at NCID. No other information about his movements prior to hospital admission has been announced.

&gt; DBS EMPLOYEE AND FAMILY MEMBER

&gt; CASE 55

&gt; One of the new cases, case 55, is a 30-year-old Singaporean with no recent travel history to China. He is a family member of case 50, a DBS employee who tested positive for the coronavirus on Wednesday.

&gt; On Thursday, case 55 was tested positive for the infection and is currently warded at NCID.

&gt; MOH provided more information on Thursday about the DBS employee.

&gt; Case 50 is a 62-year-old Singaporean man with no recent travel history to China. He had reported symptoms on Feb 7 and went to two GP clinics on Feb 7, Feb 10 and Feb 11.

&gt; He was admitted to NCID on Feb 11 and tested positive for the infection on Feb 12.

&gt; Prior to hospital admission, he had gone to work at DBS Asia Central at Marina Bay Financial Centre in 12 Marina Boulevard. He had also stayed at his home in Mei Hwan Drive other than to seek medical treatment.

&gt; 

&gt; On Thursday, MOH said case 44 – a Certis Cisco officer who served quarantine orders on two people from Wuhan - was ""a contact of cases 13 and 26"".

&gt; Case 13 was a 73-year-old woman from Wuhan who had arrived in on Jan 21, the same day as her daughter, who was case 26.

&gt; It is unclear if the Certis Cisco officer served quarantine orders on cases 13 and 26.

&gt; 

&gt; Besides the clusters linked to Grace Assembly of God and the Seletar Aerospace Heights construction site, MOH has identified three other clusters and possible clusters.

&gt; 

&gt; Three of the previous cases - cases 30, 36 and 39 - are linked to a private business meeting at Grand Hyatt Singapore from Jan 20 to Jan 22. The meeting is also linked to several other cases in Malaysia, South Korean and Britian.

&gt; A possible cluster of five cases - cases 8, 9, 31, 33 and 38 - is linked to The Life Church and Missions Singapore at 146B Paya Lebar Road.

&gt; Nine of the confirmed cases - case 19, 20, 21, 24, 25, 27, 28, 34 and 40 - are linked to the cluster associated with a shop named Yong Thai Hang in 24 Cavan Road.

&gt; 

&gt; As of Thursday, 15 people have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospital.

&gt; Seven are in critical condition in the intensive care unit – down from eight cases on Wednesday.

&gt; Of the 43 confirmed cases still in hospital, most are stable or improving, MOH said.

&gt; Contact tracing for the confirmed cases is ongoing, the ministry added. As of noon on Thursday, 1,278 close contacts have been identified.

&gt; Of the 1,161 who are in Singapore, 1,144 have been contacted and are isolated or quarantined. Efforts are ongoing to get in touch with the remaining 17 close contacts.

&gt; A total of 711 of the suspect cases have tested negative for the coronavirus, with test results for the remaining 82 pending.

&gt; As of Thursday, at least 1,367 people have died across China and nearly 60,000 have been infected.

&gt; The figures came as its central province of Hubei reported nearly 15,000 new cases after authorities changed their threshold for diagnosing the virus.

&gt; Officials said lung imaging on suspected cases is now considered sufficient to diagnose, instead of standard nucleic tests.

This was the culmination to over a decade of increasingly bad gastrointestinal and other problems. Now that shit (literally) is finally figured out and I was starting to feel more or less normal. Even all of my mental issues were finally getting straightened out, was finally thinking of getting a job, was socializing with other women my age. You know, living life. Well, as best as I could considering my dad has lymphoma that he started getting chemo done for but had a bad and lasting reaction to the chemo and so couldn't work even before this whole nightmare. And my parents have no retirement fund whats so ever. And they live in IL and we're in WA. 

On top of that we have a huge retaining wall in the back of our property that is ready to fall down and will cost a shit-ton of money to fix. We were hoping to get a home equity loan but who the fuck knows if that will be possible now. The wall is still going to fall down though. It doesn't care that everything is going to shit. Oh and to add to all of that stuff, I have a problem with my body producing too many platelets and my doctor wants me to start taking a medicine that is supposed to slow it down but would cause immunosuppression which in today's world is not very helpful. The pill bottle says that you shouldn't even touch the pills with bare hands, to use gloves, which does not fill me with confidence. It's a chemo drug essentially. 

Also I'm super paranoid that I'm going to get the fucking Corona virus and am super stressed out about every twinge and pain. I've had a stress headache for several days now which makes me even more stressed out because the doctors have told me that the platelet thing makes me more at risk for blood clots, heart attacks, and strokes which I'm sure having stress and what I'm presumably is higher blood pressure than normal will not help that. To sum things up, I really do not know how much more I can take. I can't even have a drink to chill the fuck out since I'm worried about having too much alcohol will aggravate my pancreas and make me go back to the hospital which I do not want to go to since it's disease central.",1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0

Many young corona patients in intensive care, 'probably due to carnival'

The idea that only vulnerable seniors are at risk from the coronavirus is incorrect. Of the 96 corona patients who are in intensive care in the Netherlands on Monday evening, about half are younger than 50, says Diederik Gommers, chairman of the Dutch Association for Intensive Care.

""We think that is because the outbreak is mainly in Brabant, and that it has to do with carnival. Carnival-goers are generally a bit younger.""

Doctor on corona patients in IC: 'Distribution between old and young is fifty-fifty'
In general, seniors and people who are already extra vulnerable do have more to fear from the coronavirus. ""Older people get sick faster. If you have other diseases, you are most at risk of ending up in intensive care: a bad heart, for example, diabetes or high blood pressure.""

Operating room personnel

However, healthy, younger patients also end up in IC. What is the problem with them? ""In some people, there is a kind of overreaction of the body to the virus, which causes them to develop severe pneumonia. We don't understand exactly why, but we sometimes see it during the normal flu season.""

Can the Netherlands handle it if the number of patients in intensive care increases in the coming weeks? The number of beds can be expanded to 1500, Gommers estimates. That should be enough.

""In recent years we were mainly suffering from a shortage of personnel, so we did not use all facilities. That now gives some space, but then we need personnel. What you now see is that all planned operations are canceled, and we ask the operating room personnel to help in the intensive care unit. ""

No chance without ventilation

Another risk is a possible shortage of respirators. ""We are working with all kinds of people to see if we can find additional devices, from companies and we may get 80 from the military. If we call the manufacturers in the US, Germany or Italy, we notice that all countries have such devices want to buy. ""

""
They are exhausted, can no longer breathe themselves

IC doctor Diederik Gommers on corona patients in intensive care
How are the people who end up in intensive care? Gommers: ""Those people come to the ER with respiratory problems. Often they can breathe themselves the first day, then they deteriorate hard. They have to work very hard to get air in them. They exhaust themselves, as it were, and at that point we are going to intubate. We insert a tube and take up breathing with a device. It is called 'mechanical ventilation'. ""

Without that device they have no chance. ""They are exhausted, cannot breathe themselves anymore."" A patient does not notice the ventilation: it is put to sleep, just like during an operation.

Lost pounds of muscle

The major problem for patients in intensive care is that the ventilator with the coronavirus can be needed for a very long time. ""It is really a heavy double-sided pneumonia. Usually you spend 14 days on the ventilator. But from Italy and China we know that the corona virus takes longer, which can take up to 4 weeks.""

""We also already have a few patients who have entered the fourth week. Then you actually want to reduce the support for the ventilator."" And then you have a long recovery period ahead. ""You have been kept asleep for so long, and you have been breathing for so long that you are recovering for half a year to a year. Some patients never recover completely. Because of the illness and the prolonged ventilation, you gain kilos of muscle lost.""",0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0

At least a third of my coworkers are sick, thank god I insisted on working from home ongoing. But on every zoom call someone is coughing and ill. There are a lot of people - my friends Included who are in denial about their contacts with COVID. One such friend invited my husband and I to a barbecue last weekend. When we refused because of social distancing and instead suggested FaceTime and wine, the friend revealed during our call that he was sent home because someone tested positive in his office. I am convinced that the people that are spreading this thing are asymptomatic carriers who think they are untouchable, those who refuse or are unable to call out sick from work and people who travel abroad. Another friend of a friend (who lives in LA) is extremely ill with COVID - fever, muscle aches, sweating, dry cough. She traveled to London two weeks ago and then went to a concert with my best friend in LA. 

Now my best friend is home isolating — with her partner. Problem solved right? Wrong. Her partner recently came up to NYC for a conference and wanted to hang out. These people are my closest friends and I’m just utterly shocked by how careless they’re being. But I’ve been sticking to the program and social distancing because I don’t wanna get sick. So I asked to instead FaceTime and wine. We did it. And during that call my best friend’s partner mentioned causally she had a fever and a rash but it was no big deal. THIS is why we are in our house. I cannot catch this thing and I’m good conscious give it to my friends, family, or an old person. NYC is a hub for this shit and I guess, selfish behavior.

Clear, Concise, Communication. Not rambling nonsense. This is a man who makes GW Bush sound like Roosevelt. In this scenario the best he can do is shut up and not speak because every time he opens his mouth he can't help but lie. He thinks he is cunning and smart, he's not. He just says stupid shit. 

Let's look at his ACTUAL words

"" And we continue our relentless effort to defeat the Chinese virus.""
Cool. Dog Whistle Racism at its finest. It's not like Chinese people haven't been facing insane racism driven by this sort of statement and the President of the Fucking USA should be above this. 

""Now, a drug called chloroquine — and some people would add to it “hydroxy-.”  Hydroxychloroquine.  So chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine.  Now, this is a common malaria drug.  It is also a drug used for strong arthritis.  If somebody has pretty serious arthritis, also uses this in a somewhat different form.  But it is known as a malaria drug, and it’s been around for a long time and it’s very powerful.  But the nice part is, it’s been around for a long time, so we know that if it — if things don’t go as planned, it’s not going to kill anybody.""

I have used this drug. You can straight kill someone with hypokalemia and people with heart defects can die from even normal doses. OD's are easy too. It's ""not going to kill anyone"" is a stupid statement considering 1 in 4 Americans WILL die of a cardiac issue and this drug straight up makes them worse. 

""  I don’t view it as an act of God; I would view it as is something that just surprised the whole world.  And if people would have known about it, it could have stopped — been stopped in place.  It could have been stopped right where it came from — China — if we would have known about it, if they would have known about it.""

We knew about it. The USA didn't do anything about it. Trump specifically claimed it was under control. ""Feb. 2: “Well, we pretty much shut it down coming in from China. … We can’t have thousands of people coming in who may have this problem, the coronavirus. So we’re gonna see what happens, but we did shut it down, yes.”

Feb. 7: “Nothing is easy, but [Chinese President Xi Jinping] … will be successful, especially as the weather starts to warm &amp; the virus hopefully becomes weaker, and then gone.”"" 

Let's not pretend Trump's been on the ball from the start. 

""But now the whole world, almost, is inflicted with this horrible — with this horrible virus and it’s too bad.  It’s too bad because we never had an economy as good as the economy we had just a few weeks ago.""

I mean this is just a stupid statement. People have died... and he's concerned about money. Does this make you feel secure? 

""They’ve done things in times that were not even thinkable and I’ve directed the FDA to eliminate outdated rules and bureaucracy so this work can proceed rapidly, quickly, and, I mean, fast.""

Does Trump get why there are rules in drugs?

53,"&gt;If I talk to people in factory. I hear between 15-30% production rate. For services, basically the entire country is closed. I lived there for many years so I have daily updates of the situation from locals and expats. You seem to know China we so you should know about this.

Where did you live? Maybe the situation is different depending on the province or city. For example, I've known friends and family who've restarted their businesses and people who've gone back to work in various fields like security and food services. Though admittedly, many people haven't returned to worked and business isn't good. This was mostly in the Northeast of China, which isn't as heavily hit by the coronavirus. I can't confirm specific figures like 15 - 30%, but even those production numbers are improvement from a week or two ago.

I also believe that attitudes towards isolation is starting to change amongst the Chinese populace. For example, my family hasn't gone outside for over a month now - only one person would go outside to buy food (who doesn't live with the rest of the family) and leave it at their doorstep (avoiding all contact). They were completely terrified of going outside, as if it were a scene out of the Walking Dead. Now, one family member has gone back to work and others will occasionally go out for short leisure activities. So I definitely think they'll continue to ramp up production over the next month or two, as public attitudes begin to change.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Slavery isn't about payment. It's about choice.

Fair enough.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;True for all those not toeing the party line. China doesn't take kindly to terrorist actions against the nation. I was there in 2008 when the train bomb happened. And during the knife attack in the subway as well, in 2014. Aksu. Hotan, kasgar. Urumqi.. They do have a terrorism problem there. Not happy with the method, but there's a reason there's no ""Bai"" internment camp or even Tibetan ones.

It certainly shattered the idea that Uyghurs can be peacefully integrated, and provided potential justification for their actions. But, in my opinion, terrorism isn't the main factor in the CCP's decisions. If it were, there wouldn't be hostility towards Tibet, Taiwan and other ""rightfully"" Chinese regions. I think the CCP is more concerned about political stability and unity, than terrorism.

I agree about the Bai people, but there isn't a strong separatist movement in Yunnan... Nor Inner Mongolia, or the Korean autonomous regions. As such, they are treated favorably by the government.

I wouldn't be so sure about Tibet though, though Tibetan independence movements seems to have died down over the years... The crackdowns were quite harsh after the 3-14 situation. Even if internment camps didn't exist, the CCP was certainly doing something fishy - or they wouldn't spend so much effort trying to keep the province hushed up. It's not surprising that the current chief of Xinjiang, Chen Quanguo, is the former chief of Tibet.",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0
54,"It doesn't take ""smart"" to match one number to another. If they aren't smart enough to do that fix that. Even if they don't you will forever be on record as someone who applied and got it even when you had a job... They can come ten years later if they had to. Not very smart to leave that paper trail.

Moreover the original poster is referring to moral hazard not what you are talking about... The concept that the risk is divorced from the people who spend the money. While in ordinary times you don't want to give money to people who are too ""lazy"" to find a job or who just refuse to work, it doesn't really matter in this case... Money is money bills are bills and you cannot work even if you wanted to unless you have a work from home job. So in the small small tiny nearly nonexistent case of a worker who wants unemployment doesn't have a job but could find a work from home job yes there is abuse but any other case is inapplicable right now.

You can get back to intrusive welfare state after coronavirus goal now is to hand out money. If someone's a scammer you can claw back money later or even fine them... win win. Could even be ten years later.

By the way I happen to think even if someone is lazy and doesn't want to work they should get money.

Trump didn't make us racist, sexist, or ignorant, even if he is some or all of those things. The aspect of Trump's presidency that's affected me the most frequently is that he's empowered the racist, sexist, and ignorant people I interact with to feel like their views are acceptable. 

This isn't about free speech, this isn't about a difference in political opinions- I quite literally mean certain people in the workplace and in my community in the South are openly racist and sexist because they think they ""share the views of the president."" Are their views Trump's fault? No. Does this presidency enable their ignorance? Absolutely.

In terms of magnitude, in this Presidency, I've worked in the government and alongside the government. The effects of this administration on steering the government are absurd- I've got several specific points regarding shifting in funds, focus, or how certain political decisions have impacted programs that I'm positive Trump/the Administration never even though of, but I can sum all of it up by saying **this is not an administration that listens to experts**. 

Which brings me to what I think is the most significant point, which is how misinformation is the norm. I work as a disaster analyst/disaster manager/disaster responder, typically alongside government officials. My entire profession revolves around preparing for and responding to bad things that happen. I've come to terms with the irrational reality that things like climate change's impacts on disasters are somehow still a politically sensitive subject, but when working on issues that are less sensitive, we've made it acceptable for our society to elect not to believe something because it's not convenient. 

A small, but important, part of my job is giving people bad news, having them regroup, and making a plan to move forward. Prior to this presidency, that's a challenge in itself. In this presidency, the frequency that people disregard what information is passed to them as ""fake news"" happens in a way that I never would have expected before, and particularly among those who I assume are from the Trump base. 

Also, his initial misinformation campaign about everything related to the coronavirus is downright criminal. The things he was saying (and convincing his base of) will kill people. As of yesterday, it seems as though he's changed his tune, but the fact remains that he pissed away the most important time to limit the spread of the virus because he was too damn proud to admit that he doesn't know what he's doing and that his administration is woefully unprepared for our present circumstances.",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Voici le truc : ça fait des années que je vis enfermé et au fond du gouffre, ou tout du moins à jouer sur le bord. Ça a été atroce.

Et pendant des années, j'ai fait bien des choses seul dans mon coin, c'était loin d'être rose tout les jours, même si des fois, j'arrivais plus ou moin à amortir et encaisser ce que j'avais besoin d'encaisser.

Ca durait quelques jours, quelques semaines parfois, et la vie continuait de faire son chemin, avant que je tente de bloquer tout, le tout pour le tout. Bien souvent, c'était trop pour moi, la vie. Et petit à petit, au fil de mes envies et de mes blocages, je me suis remis à voir des gens autres que mes cons habituels. Avant de rebloquer, et d'attendre que mes cons finnissent par disparaître les uns après les autres afin de pouvoir enfin me buter en paix.

Et de temps en temps, j'arrive enfin à en avoir rien à foutre d'être égoïste, et d'être en paix avec ça.

Alors oui, plus les gens sortent, plus il y aura de contaminés, plus il y aura de morts. C'est indéniable. C'est comme ça que fonctionnent tous les virus, et des virus, il y en a chaque année. Il faut limiter les sorties. Le nécéssaire, pour que la vie puisse continuer. C'est dur la mort, mais ce n'est pas une fin en soi. Evidemment qu'il faut faire des stocks pour éviter trop de sorties à l'avenir, si le besoin s'en fait réellement sentir. L'épidemie va continuer, je pense, de se develloper au cour de l'année. Après, ce qu'il en sera vraiment, de cette épidémie, personne ne peut le savoir, mais l'impact, il faut se préparer à encaisser. Il y a des consignes de bases, et chacun doit tenter de les intégrer, et il va falloir pour tout à chacun se préparer à l'impact que ce genre d'évennement apporte à la vie. Et c'est pas un guignol sur internet qui va me donner des consignes sur la manière dont je dois vivre ma vie. Quand j'entends les grands cris d'un guignol comme ça, je me dis que en voilà un qui n'est pas suffisemment aller se faire mettre. Bien au fond de lui même. Mais je sais aussi que ce n'est pas facile de faire ça.

Alors voilà : je continuerais de vivre ma vie, autant que nécéssaire, et petit à petit. Je continuerais de faire attention, bien sûr, mais ce que j'ai reçu en héritage ne se compte pas. Ca se dépense, par contre. Sinon, ça donne de drôle de résultat, et même si je suis capable d'encaisser aujourd'hui et demain, ce n'est pas forcémment le cas de tout le monde, et pas au même rythme. La vie, c'est difficile. Bien trop souvent inconcevable, vaut mieux y faire  des détours, parfois, pour réussir à l'appréhender. Trop chercher à comprendre, on se fait péter des plombs. Bref... Aller tous bien vous faire Maître. De vous même.

&gt; # [El verano de los chetos](https://www.rosario3.com/opinion/630)
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt;   
&gt; **“Éste que termina es el verano de los chetos”**. La afirmación es de una jovencita con ideas propias, testigo de una serie de hechos violentos en los que los protagonistas son varones y mujeres de una clase social (a veces también económica) acomodada. Sí, **los niños bien también pegan y dan patadas, algunas mortales como la que[recibió en la cabeza Fernando Báez Sosa](https://www.rosario3.com/informaciongeneral/Video-estremecedor-muestra-el-ataque-de-los-rugbiers-en-Villa-Gesell-20200120-0028.html)** de parte de un grupo de pibes que pasaban sus vacaciones en Villa Gesell.
&gt; 
&gt; Desde el 18 de enero pasado, la sociedad –al menos quienes se conmovieron con el crimen descarnado del chico– se hizo preguntas en relación a las motivaciones de los atacantes. Salieron publicados y se multiplicaron en radios y emisiones televisivas, análisis que intentaban explicar **por qué pibes de menos de 20 años habían desatado su furia contra un par**, solamente por un cruce menor en un boliche. Como son jugadores de rugby se apuntó a la rudeza de la disciplina deportiva y, en general, se logró acordar que acá no estaba el quid de la cuestión ya que la mayoría de los rugbiers no salen a matar personas.
&gt; 
&gt; Los muchachos que hoy están detenidos gozan de una condición económica y social de privilegio. Y como muchos de ellos, **pueden jugar al rugby, un deporte que, en general, se desarrolla en clubes con inscripción y cuotas altísimas**, más allá de que en los últimos años se ha popularizado al igual que el hockey. Son pibes que pueden vacacionar en la costa a pesar de que no trabajan y que pueden terminar la noche en un Mc Donalds. Que **consideran que esos beneficios de clase son dados naturalmente y que un “negro” no los va a venir a trastocar.**
&gt; 
&gt; Una vez más la distancia con el otro. Ojalá la usaran por estos días los chetos y así no se pasearan por el país poniendo en riesgo a sus vecinos quienes, afortunadamente, los denuncian. **¿O no es la superioridad que sienten algunos sobre los otros lo que impulsó la piña a la cabeza del guardia de seguridad en Olivos?** Ahí estaba [Miguel Ángel Paz](https://www.rosario3.com/policiales/El-agresor-del-vigilador-reconocio-que-fue-cobarde-y-pidio-perdon-20200318-0061.html) –qué paradoja de nombre– expuesto por la cámara de vigilancia de su propio edificio, dándole con fiereza al empleado que “osó” pedirle que respete la cuarentena por el coronavirus.
&gt; 
&gt; **El privilegio de clase instala una separación entre ellos y nosotros. Son kilómetros y kilómetros de hostilidad**, de desconocimiento y de indignación con lo diferente que sólo se puede sostener si los mantenemos (a los otros) a raya. Y si es necesario, que sea a los golpes.
&gt; 
&gt; Hay contextos que ponen en evidencia comportamientos que, en otro momento, se naturalizan. **Ese convencimiento de algunos de poder hacer lo que se les cante** tan sólo por el hecho de ser quiénes son se pone de manifiesto cuando [un empresario](https://www.rosario3.com/policiales/Impresionante-operativo-por-conocido-empresario-acusado-de-violar-la-cuarentena-20200318-0073.html) reconocido de Rosario considera que **puede sortear la restricción impuesta a todos las demás personas** que, como él, volvieron del extranjero.

Sin imaginarlo siquiera, se inauguraba un verano del que se quisieron apoderar unos pocos. Ésos que están convencidos que **no deben atenerse a lo que le es impuesto al resto de la sociedad** y que, atravesados por esta auto consideración, se dan licencias para trasgredir normas y derechos de los demás.

59,"DeepL translation:

On Sunday GP Carin Littooij was a guest on the TV programme Op1 and told at the table that she had tested positive for the coronavirus a few days earlier. In doing so, the GP complied with the guidelines of the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), but not with the advice of the World Health Organization WHO.

Littooij told in the broadcast on Sunday that she had tested positive for the COVID-19 virus last week. Earlier her husband had already become infected with the virus.

The fact that the doctor still participated in the programme led to a lot of criticism online. Also fellow guest and D66 party leader Rob Jetten was visibly surprised that the positively tested general practitioner was sitting at the table.

Littooij said that she had discussed her participation in the programme with the GGD and had to go to work. Nevertheless, she received a lot of criticism online, because people felt that she was endangering her fellow guests.

Littooij, who is also a member of the corona team of the National General Practitioners Association (LHV), said she complied with the RIVM guidelines. These guidelines state that patients who do not experience any symptoms for 24 hours can be considered 'cured'.

Would it have been better for Littooij to stay at home?
RIVM's advice now is: infected persons should remain in home isolation until they no longer show any symptoms for 24 hours, from a slight runny nose to a cough. At that time, according to the RIVM website, they are ""cured"" and can no longer infect others.

Littooij states in a statement of the LHV that she had been symptom-free for more than three days on Sunday (since Thursday morning). So she had already ""amply"" passed the 24-hour limit during the broadcast. Her television appearance was ""extensively tuned"" with the GGD and the RIVM.

The editors of Op1 were also aware of her infection, confirms BNNVARA. The broadcaster emphasizes that the consideration to invite the doctor was based on the advice of ""the general practitioner, the LHV, the GGD and the RIVM"".

The general practitioner went back to work on Monday, but, as a precaution, only handles consultations by telephone.

24-hour limit deviates from WHO advice
However, the guidelines of the RIVM do deviate from the advice of the WHO, which last week advised that people should remain in isolation for another two weeks after their recovery.

The 24-hour limit seems arbitrary, but according to a RIVM spokesperson it is specifically set to relieve the pressure on care in severely affected areas such as Noord-Brabant. Thanks to this limit, care personnel can quickly return to work after an infection.

It is crucial for RIVM's current policy that patients are more contagious the more symptoms they show. According to the institute, there are indications that the virus can be spread by infected persons without symptoms. However, it is still unclear what impact this has on the spread of the COVID-19 virus.",0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0
60,"Satya Nadella CEO of Microsoft since 2014, he has NOT stepped down. If you mean Gates, yeah he's not the CEO he was head of the board, he's 65 years old and wants to continue his so called philanthropic activity, there's literally a documentary on Netflix about it. Controversial figure somewhat sure but it's hardly a conspiracy.

Bob Iger CEO of Disney is 69 years old. He's been involved in a few controversial topics of late including the me too movement and Weinstein scandal. I can see why he'd want to retire. Hardly a conspiracy. 

Tinder CEO Elie Seidman has been in the position since 2017 and has NOT quit. He is not the CEO of Match. That is not correct he is the ex CEO of Okcupid.

Match CEO Mandy Ginsberg has stepped down. She had a double mastectomy some years back, her house was wrecked by a tornado and she's had to have another surgery to remove her implants due to an FDA recall. Her friend and business partner Shar Dubey is taking over, if this was a conspiracy that would be kind of odd. 

Hulu CEO Randy Freer is stepping down. Not by choice though. Hulu was acquired by Disney and it wall fall into control of Disney's central leadership hence he is not required. They did the same with ESPN. I don't see how this is a conspiracy. 

Leslie Wexner CEO of L Brands which owns Victoria's Secret is 82 years old, he's a billionaire and the longest serving CEO of an S&amp;P company ever Leslie has not officially stepped down they are discussing how much of it he'll sell. John Mehas is the CEO of Victoria's Secret. He has not stepped down. 

Virginia Rometty CEO of IBM is kind of stepping down. She's had a rocky few years and IBM has not grown and evolved as fast as the executives would have liked. Not really her fault. They were forced to evolve into cloud and AI. Funnily enough the new CEO is the head of the cloud division which makes perfect sense. She is also 62 years old. And she's not actually going anywhere she'll remain on as executive CEO. 

Mastercard CEO similar to Virginia Rometty is also kinda stepping down. Ajaypal Banga 60 years old is moving aside taking an executive CEO role to make room for Michael Miebach. Again like Rometty he's not running to a bunker. 

CEO of Harley Davidson is stepping down after a board decision. Matt Levatich has been CEO since 2009. Basically due to plumetting share prices (46%) and low sales. This is more the board shaking things up as opposed to Matt resigning and running to his bunker. Harley's been having trouble for years.

Lastly John Legere CEO of T Mobile is kinda but not really stepping aside. His contract is up April 30 and this is actually T Mobiles succession plan. They're basically doing what they're supposed to do. It's a well planned transition by the board of which Legere will now reside on and assist the new president and CEO Mike Sievert. Again no bunker running no conspiracy. 

All of this stuff is well reported and documented. 

Company CEO's have been changing hands more rapidly in the last decade because of the changing technological and economical landscapes. 

Of course when there is long awaited and long overdue crash some CEO's will resign or be told to. This is the nature of business not some stupid conspiracy. 

A sales agent company of ours at my work also shut shop on Thursday. The reasons given make perfect sense. They've been struggling for years and with this corona and economic downturn they may as well pull the plug now instead of struggling and going into debt potentially only to quit later in the year anyway. I know this last part is anecdotal but it goes to show you that money makes the world go round, not conspiracies.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I pass on information from Czech friends, they come from a doctor who works in a hospital in Shenzhen.  
&gt;  
&gt;He participated in the study of viral pneumonia in Wu-chan.  
&gt;  
&gt;Coronavirus pneumonia manifests itself as a dry cough without a cold! It's easiest to identify.  
&gt;  
&gt;Wuhan virus is not heat resistant, it dies at 26-27 degrees C.  
&gt;  
&gt;Therefore, drink more warm water. If it doesn't help, it doesn't hurt.  
&gt;  
&gt;Come to the sun more often, drink warm water.  
&gt;  
&gt;This is not a medicine, but useful, does not burden the body.  
&gt;  
&gt;Drinking warm water is effective against many viruses.  
&gt;  
&gt;Avoid drinking cold drinks, ice, do not eat ice cream ...  
&gt;  
&gt;Doctor's recommendation for coronavirus:  
&gt;  
&gt;1. The diameter of viral cells is around 400-500 nm, so any mask can filter it not only the N95 model.  
&gt;  
&gt;If an infected person sneezes, the virus will spread about 3 meters before it falls to the ground and stays there.  
&gt;  
&gt;2. When it is on the metal surface, it lives for at least 12 hours.  
&gt;  
&gt;Remember, because if you touch any metal surface (door handles, keyboards, buttons in the elevator, you need to thoroughly wash your hands with soap.  
&gt;  
&gt;3. The virus may remain active on tissue, clothing for 6 to 12 hours. Normal washing should kill the virus.  
&gt;  
&gt;As for winter clothing, which can not be washed often, it is recommended to put it in the sun to kill viruses.  
&gt;  
&gt;The new NCP coronavirus in your body doesn't have to show signs of infection for days, so how do you know if you are infected?  
&gt;  
&gt;According to the latest data, the incubation period can take up to 28 days for COVID 19.  
&gt;  
&gt;Taiwanese experts provide a simple self-test that we can do every morning.  
&gt;  
&gt;Take a deep breath and hold your breath for more than 10 seconds. If you successfully complete the test without coughing, discomfort, congestion, tension, etc., it is proved that there is no cystic fibrosis in the lungs, which basically means no infection.  
&gt;  
&gt;In critical times, go out into the fresh air every morning.  
&gt;  
&gt;Everyone should ensure that his mouth and neck (esophagus, I think?) Are wet.  
&gt;  
&gt;Drink a few sips of water every 15 minutes. Why?  
&gt;  
&gt;Even if the virus enters the mouth, drinking water or other fluids flush it into the esophagus and stomach. Once it's there, the acid in your stomach will kill. If you don't drink enough water, the virus can break through your airways and enter your lungs. It's very dangerous. Please send an SMS about coronavirus to others and share it with family, friends and everyone. (Translation from Czech)",0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
62,"One increased measure we can all take: wear a bandana or scarf when we must be out in public. See below, spread the word.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    
If you must leave your house then cover your face. Any kind of face covering - a scarf or bandana for instance - will help to reduce transmission rates.   
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     
Key points:-     
1/ You can be infected without showing: protect others by wearing a home-made mask.    
2/ Home-made masks will help stop hand-face transmission.    
3/ Wearing a home-made mask will help normalise the behaviour. The more people that are wearing masks, the lower the transmission rates. In the event you have an n95 mask and fear adverse reaction from fellow commuters, wear a bandana over the top.

Any type of general mask use is likely to decrease viral exposure and infection risk on a population level, in spite of imperfect fit and imperfect adherence""

There will never be a definitive scientific study proving the effectiveness of masks. As pointed out by Dr David Hui a respiratory medicine expert at Chinese University of Hong Kong who studied the 2002-2003 outbreak of SARS, a properly controlled study would be impossible to conduct ethically. “You can’t randomize people to not wear a mask, and some to wear a mask, and then expose them all to the virus.” He points out that it is ""common sense"" that wearing a mask would assist in protecting against covid-19.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     
Government policy and law:-    
The USA's CDC suggests - as a very last resort - that scarves and bandanas be used by health care workers facing patients known to be infected with covid-19. If it is an appropriate recommendation for health care workers facing known live cases, then it is appropriate that everyone now wear a scarf or bandana when they must be in public.

SARS-CoV-2 were identified in two separate cDNA pools. The first pool was from a Carassius auratus (crusian carp) cell line and the second was from Ctenopharyngodon idella(grass carp) head kidney tissue (6, 7)

Turns out both these samples to the database were submitted from Wuhan.

So let's examine some of the coincidences so far:

-- a new bat derived coronavirus appears in a market close to the only lab in China known to be working with bat derived corona viruses

-- the new virus has a bizarre genetic overlap with the carp genome

-- the carp genome was submitted by researchers working out of Wuhan

-- the new virus has slight but functionally important genetic similarities to HIV; not a smoking gun, but the only coronavirus with said mutation... but wait! no there is one in nature with this mutation... published Jan 20, after the outbreak started... from researchers working out of -- you guessed it -- Wuhan

I won't explicitly say it, because people get banned and censored for doing so, and more importantly, these days I am happy if I can simply get my aged mother and people like her to avoid gatherings and wear a mask. I don't want to distance myself further from the mainstream narration. There isn't too much to be gained focusing on the origin at this point. That will need to come later though. We want to deal with this in a way that doesn't devolve into letting nukes fly.

64,"The naming scheme is causing lot of confusion, maybe opening the names up helps a bit:

**Coronavirus**  
A large group of viruses, most cause very mild symptoms, usually related to respiratory system, to humans. Only very few of them are lethal.

**SARS** - **S**evere **A**cute **R**espiratory **S**yndrome  
This is what this strain of the Coronavirus causes,
So it was added to the name.

**SARS-CoV** - SARS-**Co**rona**V**irus. 
This is the original ”SARS” from 2002.

**SARS-CoV2**  
The current Corona that originates from Wuhan. Moderately closely related to the original SARS-virus which is why this name was chosen.

**COVID-19** - **Co**rona**Vi**rus **D**isease (20)**19**  
Sometimes the disease that the virus causes is given it's own name. Just like HIV causes AIDS. COVID-19 is the disease you get from SARS-CoV2. The name was AFAIK given because WHO wanted to avoid confusion between this and the original SARS.

66,"Dear Families,

Humble ISD understands that each family has unique concerns, due to health or other circumstances, about Coronavirus COVID-19. Our schools have precautionary measures in place to assist public health officials in their goal of containment. We want you to know that Humble ISD will support parents in making the best decisions for their families. More specifically, schools will work with individual families in the best interest of each child.

We think it is important to reiterate that at this time there are no cases reported in Humble ISD. However, this is a rapidly evolving situation and we are constantly monitoring the information coming from health officials and experts.

Humble ISD will continue to follow the recommendations of the Harris County Public Health Department and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 

Please note the following new measures put in place: 

Parents must report to the school if their child travels to or through countries with a Level 3 Travel Health Notice. As of March 6, those countries were China, Iran, South Korea and Italy. The list is subject to change and may be found at https://www.cdc.gov/coronairus/2019-ncov/travelers/after-travel-precuations.html. During Spring Break, parents should report travel to an identified country by emailing HealthServices@humbleisd.net. After Spring Break, parents should report travel to an identified country to their school nurse. 
All Humble ISD employees are required to report travel to or through identified countries. The health of students and staff who travel will be monitored in accordance with public health guidelines before they are permitted to be at school. 
All new students will be screened by campus nurses, until further notice, before attending classes at an Humble ISD school.
The District will not count absences that occur from March 16-27 for perfect attendance awards and exam exemptions. We will pause these two programs for the two weeks after Spring Break while we monitor information related to Coronavirus COVID-19.  
Every school and school bus will undergo deep cleaning and disinfection, including the use of fogging machines, during Spring Break. Deep cleaning and disinfection will continue when students return after Spring Break.
Families with extenuating circumstances should contact their campus principal. We are committed to doing what we can to support the unique needs of students.  
On-going measures include:

All nurses are being provided with updates on a regular basis and have received guidance on screening and evaluation protocols. Nurses will keep a close watch on any student who comes to the clinic with fever or flu-like symptoms. If a student has a fever of 100 degrees or more, parents will be called to pick up their child.

Humble ISD staff will continue to educate our students, staff, and community members about the importance of frequent hand washing; covering a cough or sneeze; not touching one’s eyes, nose, and mouth; staying home when sick; and other measures to help prevent the spread of communicable diseases.

Humble ISD Custodial Services are routinely cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched objects and surfaces with H2Orange2 cleaner which is effective against multiple disease-causing viruses and bacteria. In addition, extra hand sanitizer will be delivered to all Humble ISD campuses.
It is important to note that we are in the midst of our regular cold and flu season, so it is important for our community to take preventative measures to safeguard against the spread of communicable diseases. Local and federal health authorities indicate that the best ways to prevent the spread of the Coronavirus are the same recommendations for preventing the spread of the Flu virus.

Parents/Guardians can help by:

Keeping children home who are sick. If your child has a fever of 100 degrees or more, he or she should stay home from school until fever-free for 24 hours without fever-reducing medications.

Reinforcing frequent hand washing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.
Reinforcing covering a sneeze or cough with a tissue or one’s sleeve (not your hands).

67,"&gt; The economy is going to tank in either model, and we are so intertwined that the lowest common denominator economically will bring the other down.

Not wrong in general effect, but the particulars are very different.  With lockdown, almost all economic activity fails hard, simultaneously.  With controlled infection rates, the economic effects are spread out more over time and not all sectors will be equally hit equally badly.

It is particularly important for a national economy that *some* remnant of it remain functional, because it's that remnant that will rebuild the rest of it.

&gt; Global contagion will mean that no economy can avoid a massive recession.

I'd argue that how deep and how long the recession depends a lot on policy.

We've been overdue a recession anyway, and I expect that if anything were likely to precipitate another GFC, it might be something like covid-19.  Or not.  

Tricky thing is: what made the GFC so bad was that debt default was the cause of recession, not a symptom of it.  With this, default would be a symptom of job losses rather than a cause, the primary cause being viral.  For as long as the virus continues to be a problem, so will recession, but once the source of the problem is removed the recovery might (just might) be a lot faster than was the case with the GFC.

In fact, I'd argue that the world economy *never did* recover from the GFC.  Not properly.  And maybe never will.

&gt; However, in one respect the UK's situation will actually be worse, economically - The effect of widespread sickness that will be sweeping the country.

Depends on how callous one is willing to be.  Say we do nothing, everyone gets the virus and the mortality rate is 1%†.  That's 660k deaths.  Sounds pretty horrendous?  It is.

But, to be callous, that's about two years' worth of net immigration at its peak.  That's a bit more than Sheffield.  One event that killed the equivalent of the whole of Sheffield would be an eye-wateringly shocking event, and yet nobody seemed to care that population went up by about half that rate every year so, superficially, why is it worse to lose population at that rate?  It'd be the same in effect (albeit less shocking) if net immigration inverted to be net emigration.

That's the *absolute worst case* effect if we did nothing at all.  Over in the *FT* comments section, I speculated whether active management might do more harm than letting nature take its course:

&gt;&gt;&gt; I do wonder which would do more long-term damage: 'active management' including shutting borders or controls on movement and goods — or doing nothing at all.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Will active management substantially reduce the final death toll given that it is inevitable to become as common and widely distributed as any other cold or 'flu?  It is 'when?' rather than 'if?' and the only choice is infection rate profiles and what economic cost any given authority is willing to pay.

Again, that number of deaths would be both grievous and shocking but, in hard economics, sudden loss of 1% of the population is probably not nearly so damaging as the effects of extended lockdown that would arrest most industries and destroy others.  

† mortality rate is probably a lot less.  Actual number for the UK, superficially, is currently 1.8% based on 20 deaths out of 1140 **known** infections.  It is certain that there are many more unrecorded cases and that perhaps anywhere between 1 in 2 and 1 in 10 are known.  Wild arsed guess.  1% is a nice round figure and 0.1% is excessively optimistic.

&gt; Many more people will be hospitalised under the herd immunity model, and many will take months to recover. Missing a very significant percentage of the workforce at various times due to debilitating illness will be devastating.

That's true, but lock-down has much the same effect, economically.  It's also not the variable which the ""herd immunity effect"" seeks to optimise.

&gt; Lockdown is bad, but at least the numbers of infected and unable to work will be much lower. It doesn't really matter, economically, if people have to work from home (and governments can order that to be done, wherever possible). It does matter when they cannot work full stop.

Lockdown isn't sustainable long term, which means that it's only delaying the inevitable.  And I suspect that more jobs can't be done remotely than can.

&gt; Also, in the lockdown model, by having much lower numbers of infected overall, there is much less chance of those who do need to physically go to work becoming infected - hence you afford more protection to critical jobs, medical worker, supply chain etc.

That's the only real merit to recommend lockdown: time to gear up and reining in the critical cases to within limits that the NHS can manage — at least, until the lockdown period is over.  If, as is being forecast (and [as happened with the 1918 Spanish 'flu pandemic](https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=228841)), those countries that went into lockdown will see a second wave in six months' time.  Maybe the world will be better prepared, but the beginnings of recovery after the first wave will be wiped out very quickly.

&gt; Do these measures you outlined not counter the UK's plan though?

Probably not.  One argument says that people ought to be able to make their own risk assessments, but that idea doesn't acknowledge that one does not risk only one's own health but that of unknowable others unless they choose to self-isolate.

Making it easier to self-isolate might alter a coefficient or two but, for that same reason, it probably won't stop everyone being exposed sooner or later.  And even the UKG's own intention was never to leave this completely to natural processes but choose when to impose increasing restrictions rather than going all out to begin with.  C.f. the analogy I made earlier in pest control: if you fire all your guns at once, you've got nothing left when you need a second salvo.

&gt; The virus needs to go through the population in order for the model to work. You shouldn't be trying to prevent infection in the younger, working population.

Yes, but the model doesn't particularly depend on a given time frame, unless you want to try to build that herd immunity before next winter in which case the programme would have to be sufficiently aggressive as to risk enough lives to defeat the objective, if lives lost is your primary concern (as presumably it is if one wishes to avoid confronting covid-19 + winter '20-'21 + possibly WTO trade barriers from 1 Jan 21).

&gt; No home office for the under 50s, no home shopping - we need you out there in the mixer

Which presupposes there's negligible intergenerational contact, which is certainly not the case.

&gt; While it sounds reasonable in the abstract, I don't know if people will be able to take the UK model, mentally, when it actually happens.

Right.

&gt; Even worse, people will know that they are infecting others, and in some cases, they will infect their own vulnerable relatives.

That's why epidemiology is a bastard.  It just isn't as amenable to control as theory suggests, which is why lockdown is of dubious merit.

&gt; I fear it is simply too much of a burden to expect them to bear. There is a certain comfort in fighting, even if you might not win.

There's more than one way to fight, and it's going to be traumatic whichever way it is done.",0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0
68,"3:30 a.m. American tourist becomes 1st case in Bhutan

An American tourist in Bhutan has been diagnosed with the novel coronavirus as the first confirmed case in the South Asian country, situated on the Himalayas’ eastern edge, prompting officials there to temporarily ban all incoming tourists and shutter schools in three regions.

Bhutan's Office of the Prime Minister and Cabinet announced the case in a press release early Friday morning, saying the patient is a 76-year-old U.S. citizen who had entered the country via a flight from India on Monday.

The man left Washington, D.C., on Feb. 18 and toured India from Feb. 21 to March 1. He was traveling with his 58-year-old partner, according to Bhutan's Office of the Prime Minister and Cabinet.

Upon arriving at Bhutan's Paro International Airport, officials assessed the man's health declaration form, on which he had indicated ""negative"" against all conditions. He did not show any signs of fever, officials said.

However, upon reaching the capital, Thimphu, later that afternoon, the man went to a hospital complaining of bloat and nausea. He suffers from chronic hypertension and is on medication. At that time, he did not have any flu-like symptoms, officials said.

On Wednesday, the man traveled to Punakha, a town in the Himalayas of Bhutan, where he stayed at Densa Boutique Resort. Upon returning to Thimphu on Thursday, he went back to the hospital again and was found to have a fever, sore throat, cough and shortness of breath. He was kept under observation at the flu clinic, which has become a designated coronavirus hospital, and samples were collected and sent to Bhutan's Royal Center for Disease Control for testing, officials said.

The test results came back positive for COVID-19 late Thursday night and were validated early Friday morning. Since then, he has been isolated in the coronavirus hospital.

By Friday morning, health officials have traced more than 90 people who had come in contact with the American tourist in Bhutan.

In response to the detection of COVID-19 in the country, the government of Bhutan has ordered the closure of schools and institutions in three regions and has banned public gatherings in the affected localities.

The government has also imposed a two-week restriction on all incoming tourists, effective immediately.

""This is to enable rigorous monitoring, source assessment of infection and mitigate the situation,"" Bhutan's Office of the Prime Minister and Cabinet said in a statement Friday. ""The government will assess the situation after two weeks and accordingly decide on the restrictions.""",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

A video here by Chiropractor Sir John Bergman offers insight and a survival plan to better deal with Covid-19 (Corona Virus)

You'll be glad to know there's more we all can do to see this outbreak through:

(This info is from the many slides included in John Bergman's video)

+ STRENGTHEN YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM +

Supplements; the following inexpensive supplemental levels are recommended for adults; for children reduce these in proportion to body weight: 

- Vitamin C  (3,000 milligrams daily, or more,  in divided doses)

- Vitamin D3 (5,000 International Units/day until summer, then reduce to 2,000)

- Magnesium (400 mg daily)

- Zinc (20 mg daily)

- Selenium (100 micrograms daily)

- Lugol's Iodine (daily)

- Activated Charcoal (daily)

Also Helpful:

- Exercise

- Conscious breathing

- Sleep (7.5 hr/night)

- Play

- Organic plant-based diet

- Prayer/Meditation

-Essential Oils (multiple times a day)

- Hot drinks (88 degrees or more)


Quotes from Dr. Cheng: 

""Vitamin C is very promising for prevention, and especially important to treat dying patients when there is no better treatment. Over 2,000 people have died of the Covid-19 outbreak and yet I have not seen or heard large dose intravenous Vitamin C being used in any of the cases. The current sole focus on vaccine and specific antiviral drugs for epidemics is misplaced.""

Cheng added:

""Early and sufficiently large doses of intravenous Vitamin C are critical. Vitamin C is not only a prototypical antioxidant, but also involved in virus killing and prevention of viral replication. The significance of large dose Vitamin C is not just at an antiviral level. It is actue respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that kills most people from coronaviral pandemics (SARS, MERS and now NCP). ARDS is a common final pathway leading to death. 

We therefore call for a world-wide discussion and debate on this topic.""

+++

Another slide says: 

""The physicians of the Orthomolecular Medicine News Service and the International Society for Orthomolecular Medicine urge a nutrient-based method to prevent or minimize symptoms for future viral infection. 

The basis for using high doses of Vitamin C to prevent and combat virus-caused illness may be traced back to Vitamin C's early success against polio, first reported in the late 1940's. Many people are unaware, even surprised, to learn this.

Further clinical evidence built up over the decades, leading to an anti-virus protocol published in 1980. It is important to remember that preventing and treating respiratory illnesses with large amounts of Vitamin C is well established.""

Pay attention also to what's said of one Antoine Bechamp:

""Had the profound voice of his science not been silenced, much of humankind may have been spared the worst aspects of the infectious or vital stresses of the 20th century.""

79,"I made this comment (below this paragraph) on another post and posting here due to the location of death. This news makes me sad and even more anxious as I continue to think about our older adult residents. Our local government can do much more, we are past containment. The officials need to also prioritize mitigation efforts in conjunction with containment, and to be more proactive about helping our most vulnerable group, our older adults. Per the county website, ""The County of Santa Clara has always provided the services that hold the fabric of our society together. While cities in California primarily exist to protect property, counties exist to protect people and the community which they live."" We need to make our local government and elected officials take this crisis more seriously and take more actions to ""protect people and the community in which they live.""

The County of Santa Clara is the third largest employer in silicon valley (after Apple and Google). Although the County Executive released a guidance to county departments last week that said, ""consider use of telecommuting options for employees,"" county employees are still physically coming to work as of today. I find this very concerning, since a guidance is not a policy but just a recommendation, and with the numbers of confirmed cases in the county increasing rapidly in the past week, it's irresponsible for the third largest employer (approximately 20k employees) to not take a stronger stance to protect the population that it exists to serve by making its employees who can work remotely do so. This demonstrates a lack of effort to mitigate the effects of the continuing spread of the coronavirus on health of the residents, and a lack of value for life, especially lives of older adults.

Approximately 17% of Santa Clara county residents are 60 years old and older, and 37% of these residents reported living in non-family households (and 34% of the 37% reported living alone). The Department of Aging and Adult Services, which ""evaluates community needs, develops programs and services, and advices on matters of policy that concern the welfare of seniors and persons with disabilities,"" still hasn't made an official statement as of today about what it's doing to assist and protect the county's seniors, the most vulnerable population during this crisis. 

It looks like the local government is not looking out enough for our older adults - our family members, our neighbors, our friends. I implore everyone to please step up and help older adults you know since the local government hasn't done enough so our older adults, who are a highly valued part of our community, can be protected.

Confirmed cases in the county in the last week:

March 2: 9 cases 

March 3: 11 cases

March 4: 14 cases

March 5: 20 cases 

March 6: 24 cases

More generally as a word of caution about BioRxiv:

&gt; bioRxiv is receiving many new papers on coronavirus 2019-nCoV. A reminder: these are preliminary reports that have not been peer-reviewed. They should not be regarded as conclusive, guide clinical practice/health-related behavior, or be reported in news media as established information.

[More information about what this means](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/what-unrefereed-preprint):

&gt; Before formal publication in a scholarly journal, scientific and medical articles are traditionally ""peer reviewed."" In this process, the journal’s editors take advice from various experts—called ""referees""—who have assessed the paper and may identify weaknesses in its assumptions, methods, and conclusions. Typically a journal will only publish an article once the editors are satisfied that the authors have addressed referees’ concerns.

&gt; Because this process can be lengthy, authors use the bioRxiv service to make their manuscripts available as ""preprints"" before completing peer review and consequent certification by a journal. This allows other scientists to see, discuss, and comment on the findings immediately. Readers should therefore be aware that articles on bioRxiv have not been finalized by authors, might contain errors, and report information that has not yet been accepted or endorsed in any way by the scientific or medical community.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

This is in part because the infection can last a long time, *weeks* even. Also, rather the flu which peaks in 2 or 3 days, some people keep getting worse and worse and worse for many days on end so it’s not unusual for them to die 15 or 20 days after they contracted it.

83,"Re: Training

Delivery doesn't require an inordinate amount of training

I'm not sure what's involve in testing someone for COVID-19 but wrt to cluster identification, it's a single process, so even if it's a complex process, it can be split into simpler part, like a production line. By training people in parallel to perform their bit in the COVID-19 testing process, large numbers could be trained to do this one thing in a realistic time frame. Perhaps, you would get a bunch of false negatives, but if the process produces one positive result per cluster, then you can bring more highly trained people in to contact trace and run more accurate tests on the contacts of the COVID-19 positive case.

Fordism can also be applied to the manufacturing of PPE. I.e. training people to perform relatively simple tasks and joining them together into a production line.

&amp;#x200B;

In the past, it is true that training people required bring many students or rookies together in the physical presence of a teacher. Today though, you can train people with videos, online course and online tests.

&amp;#x200B;

It's certainly true that economic activity does run the risk of infection, but, at the same time, we cannot neglect putting food on people's plates, keeping the water running, keeping the electricity and internet working etc., etc.,

Building up these vast reserves of delivery people and COVID-19 testers will require activity. Again, I think the best way to ensure the activity does not spread contagion is to ensure that the same people who work together, live together. That will serve to break up the household - workgroup - household - work group chain of transmission.

As for the armies of recruits manufacturing PPE, so long as they wear the first PPE that they manufacture, then hopefully they will not infect each other. Or at least the degree to which the PPE they produce stops people from infecting each other is greater than the degree that co-workers in PPE production plants infect each other.

Perhaps an alternative to PPE production plants would be to make PPE a cottage industry. Where someone would apply to manufacture PPE as part of the containment effort, from existing, readily available,  mass-produced goods on a website. Then everyday, a delivery man would drop the PPE components at the door of volunteers, and every evening, the volunteers would leave the final assembled PPE pieces outside their door.

That might be a good way to get volunteers to manufacture PPE without compromising on Social Distancing.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Re: Flattening The Curve Situation

I find it interesting that your criticism of my second point almost directly contradicts your criticism of my first.

You mentioned a problem with building up ""an army"" of workers to help in the containment effort takes time and effort and raises the chance of infection on the one hand in your response to ""training the army of volunteers"".

And yet in your response to flattening the curve you are suggesting that the capacity of the medical system can be increased exponentially at the same rate as the virus (provided we dampen down the exponential of the virus).

If training ""armies"" of people to deliver food to people's door on short notice, is impractical, think how much more, impractical it will be to train ""armies of doctors and nurses"" to treat an exponentially rising number of patients.

If getting people to manufacture PPE in their own houses with key ingredients delivered to their door could be counterproductive by raising the risk of infection, think how much more counterproductive it will be with respect to spreading the infection, to bring an exponentially increasing number of rookies/volunteers with no or minimal medical training into hospital wards filled with infected patients.

Think how counterproductive it might be to ask exponentially more people to handle extremely sophisticated medical equipment which they have little training or experience handling.

Might poorly-trained volunteers not end up doing more harm then good if they deliver treatment to patients that are counter-productive?

&amp;#x200B;

While is is true that medical equipment will increase with time. Skilled medical personnel are, on the timescale of the COVID-19 outbreak, to all intents and purposes, finite.

&amp;#x200B;

Indeed, pessimistically, it might be even worse. If medical personnel start dying, the medical capacity might even reduce somewhat. If medical personel quit their jobs for fear of their life it could also reduce (although I don't think many will do that), but even if 95% of medical personnel neith die, nor quit, if medical personnel work themselves to exhaustion and suffer burnout (which is highly like) this would actually tend to reduce the capacity of the healthcare system.

&amp;#x200B;

IMHO it will actually be must easier to recruit manpower into low-risk containment-related activities (delivering food to peoples doors, manufacturing PPE - maybe even testing saliva samples for COVID-19 could be made low risk is patients post the samples to them or something)

&amp;#x200B;

It will be considerable harder to recruit people to engage in treatment activities, which require a high level of skills and will involve a very high risk to life and limb in  workplace that resembles a house of horrors.",0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0
84,"Healthcare workers go in the bunny suits (aka the full hazmat suits) for a few reasons:

1) As others have noted, in general there are shortages of healthcare workers (in many areas, even at the best of times) and you really don't want someone getting sick on the job.

2) In the event there are multiple strains going around (which doesn't seem to be the case for Wuhan-CoV, but in future could be--or can be true for other cruds, too) you don't want those two strains mixing and swapping genetic material through recombination and making a potentially nastier ""hybrid virus"".

3) Hospital workers also go around in the bunny suits to prevent what's called ""nosocomial infections""--that is, infections spread to people who were not sick with Wuhan-CoV but were in hospital for different reasons altogether.

4) As amazing as it may sound...hospitals with infectious disease wards do all of this for *any particularly nasty contagious disease, including measles and the chickenpox.*  (Yes, the children's hospital chain in my area--we have three children's hospitals--actually has a small infectious disease ward.  With negative airflow rooms and HEPA filters.  And staff will go in with bunny suits, particularly if it's something without a good vaccine.  And yes, that includes Dat Flu.  You know the one.  *Dat Flu.*)

In a home environment...typically you're not veritably marinating yourself in infectious material (including droplets coughed by multiple people with the blerg, much less Icky Bodily Fluids) for upwards of eight to sixteen hours a day (and the latter is more likely with ER staff--many of whom are interns on rotations--or during a public health emergency  like an epidemic).  You're generally dealing with one to two, maybe three, sick people.  You're not dealing with the possibility of multiple strains of the Blerg effectively Having Microbiological Nookie.  You're generally not having to worry about spreading the crud to others as much.

And since you're in a home environment, and you can always Disinfect The Things with some bleach wipes or Lysol...you don't need to go for the full bunny suit.  (Besides, those things are expensive!)  You likely don't have a ""clean room"" where you can pretty much do a full change of clothing and someone to help you into and out of said bunny suit (hospitals do).

(Now, if you DO have a pre-existing condition like diabetes or asthma, or are on cancer chemo or take certain drugs to prevent organ rejection or to manage diseases like rheumatoid arthritis or lupus or Crohn's Disease...yes, I'd do a consult with your medical professionals that help you manage this stuff, to the effect of ""What should I add to my treatment action plan to prevent Wuhan-CoV, and what should I do if I suspect I've contracted it?""  Which is a good idea anyways, and the advice is probably going to be the same as preventing really bad colds or flu in a year where the flu shot isn't as effective as usual.)",0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0

86,"Not a fan of soft paywalls, here's the full article for anyone like me who doesn't want to register an account.

&gt;  UPDATED March 19, 2020: This story has been updated to clarify the study findings. 
&gt; 
&gt; Patients with gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms who were admitted to the hospital and were diagnosed with COVID-19 were more likely to have severe disease than patients who did not have GI symptoms, according to findings published March 18 in the American Journal of Gastroenterology.
&gt; 
&gt; However, the unexpectedly large proportion is due in part to the inclusion of anorexia, said Brennan M. R. Spiegel, MD, MSHS, co–editor-in-chief of the American Journal of Gastroenterology.
&gt; 
&gt; ""If you leave out anorexia, which is very nonspecific, the percentage of COVID-19 patients with GI symptoms is about 30%,"" Spiegel told Medscape Medical News.
&gt; 
&gt; Lei Pan, MD, PhD, of Binzhou Medical University Hospital in Binzhou, China, and colleagues in the Wuhan Medical Treatment Expert Group conducted a descriptive, cross-sectional, multicenter study on 204 patients who had polymerase chain reaction–confirmed COVID-19 at three hospitals in Hubei province from January 18, 2020, to February 28, 2020. The team considered clinical characteristics, laboratory data, and treatment.
&gt; 
&gt; Ninety-nine patients (48.5%) presented to the hospital with digestive symptoms as their chief complaint. Most of these patients did not have underlying digestive diseases. Their symptoms included anorexia (83.8%), diarrhea (29.3%), vomiting (0.8%), and abdominal pain (0.4%).
&gt; 
&gt; Like Spiegel, David A. Johnson, MD, professor of medicine and chief of gastroenterology at the Eastern Virginia School of Medicine in Norfolk, says that the patients with anorexia should be excluded. A more realistic ― if high ― estimate is the 29% who presented with diarrhea, Johnson says.
&gt; 
&gt; ""Other GI problems ― abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting ― may raise the percentage slightly from the 29%,"" Johnson said.
&gt; 
&gt; For the overall study population, Pan and colleagues found that the average time from symptom onset to hospital admission was 8.1 days. However, it was 9.0 days for patients with GI symptoms, including those with anorexia, compared with 7.3 days for those who did not have digestive symptoms. Seven patients had digestive symptoms but no respiratory symptoms at admission.
&gt; 
&gt; Digestive symptoms appeared to be tied to worse outcomes. Whereas 60% of patients without digestive symptoms recovered and were discharged, only 34.3% of the patients with digestive symptoms recovered.
&gt; 
&gt; Spiegel explained how the digestive symptoms arise. ""The virus enters human cells through the ACE2 receptor in the lungs but also in other body parts, including the GI tract. We think the virus gets into saliva and we swallow it, and then it passes through the acid layer in some patients and uses the ACE2 receptors to enter epithelial cells that line the intestine.""
&gt; 
&gt; The virus replicates rapidly in the cells of the GI lining, enters the intestinal tract, and is shed, Spiegel said. ""There is clear evidence from endoscopy that it can damage the stomach and the intestines. The fact that these patients do worse may be that more of the body is involved.""
&gt; 
&gt; An explanation for the longer time between symptom onset and COVID-19 diagnosis might be that patients with only GI symptoms or mild respiratory complaints did not think that they could have the coronavirus.
&gt; 
&gt; ""When the patients were admitted to the hospital, no one yet knew they had COVID-19. Almost half, when asked why they were there, mentioned a digestive problem. They may have also had a respiratory symptom, like a cough or shortness of breath, but that's not what they said was their main complaint,"" Spiegel told Medscape Medical News.
&gt; 
&gt; The authors conclude, ""Clinicians should recognize that digestive symptoms, such as diarrhea, may be a presenting feature of COVID-19, and that the index of suspicion may need to be raised earlier in at-risk patients presenting with digestive symptoms rather than waiting for respiratory symptoms to emerge.""
&gt; 
&gt; Spiegel points out that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has yet to include GI symptoms in their guidance, although recommendations are changing rapidly.
&gt; 
&gt; Spiegel urges caution in evaluating patients with only GI symptoms. ""A large part of the population has diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting regularly, so it's clearly impossible and irresponsible to start testing everyone with diarrhea for COVID-19. But if somebody has new fever and diarrhea and suspects they may have had contact with a patient or carrier, I'd want to test them.""
&gt; 
&gt; Limitations of the study include a relatively small sample, the retrospective design, and not testing for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in stool.",0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0

Good evening. If you are tagged in this you are family, or very close to my family. I hope that you will take my words to heart and listen.

I have been in healthcare all my life, and now, over 30 years in I am now an ICU nurse practitioner dealing with critical illness and life support issues. Those of you who have come to me for advice in the past know that I am a straight shooter and i have never bullshitted you on matters of health. With that in mind....here we go.

COVID19 is here. In America. NOW. Circulating in communities, both detected and undetected. There is no stopping it. COVID19 is a respiratory illness caused by SARS-CoV2, a new (novel is the scientific word) strain of coronavirus that has emerged in humans since December 2019. It is related to the SARS virus that circulated in 2002-3. We got lucky then. Our luck is not so good this time.

It is not the flu. It doesn't feel like the flu. And it is deadlier than the flu by every measure we have undertaken in affected countries. It will make the rounds and many of us will catch it. Most of us wont have a problem with it however... a significant number of us will get fairly sick and may need hospitalization... of those about half of those hospitalized will likely end up in the ICU and possibly on breathing machines... and of those sickest, there will be deaths. COVID19 at its best is showing a 0.8% mortality rate, which is 3x worse than the flu. That is in countries that have extensive testing and detected both the well AND unwell who are positive for the SARS-CoV2 virus, which causes the COVID19 illness.

There are 350 million folks in america, roughly. People are throwing around this number of ""less than one percent"". Well let me tell you: Do the math. A very small percentage of a very large number is STILL a large number.

Symptoms of the Flu involve your body feeling like everything hurts, and you got run over by a mack truck and you just feel awful.. in addition to upper respiratory symptoms.

COVID19 is different. You may or may not have a runny nose and fever. A sore throat becomes a major common finding.. then it gets in the lungs. A dry, nonproductive cough is common, followed or accompanied by shortness of breath. The shortness of breath is what is triggering hospital visits, and the folks presenting to the hospitals show low oxygen levels (oxygen saturations) and chest imaging typically shows a bilateral diffuse pneumonia (Double pneumonia for the laypeople).

The only proven effective therapies are supportive- Oxygen, and positive pressure ventilation... either with a cpap/bipap machine or with a mechanical ventilator attached to a breathing tube. There is no cure. Your body has to fight it off and it has to run its course. There is no Tamiflu equivalent that works for this. There are some smart medical folks out there spitballing some ideas, but nothing is proven to work. So like every other viral illness you have gotten, you have to ride it out and hope your body is strong enough.

Babies and children are making out fairly Ok.. even if they test positive they havent been dying of it in China, in Italy... however healthy young adults, even athletic types, in their 30's-50's are coming in very sick and some are dying. From there, the older one is, the higher the hospitalization rates and the mortality rates.

Information out of China shows that it was killing men more than women, but one thing to note is that in China, older men are invariably tobacco smokers. Information out of Italy appears to show the obese are having a worse time with it. In general, blood pressure and diabetes are associated with higher rates of severe illness and death. In particular, people takeing ACE Inhibitors or ARB's for their blood pressure (the drugs ending in ""pril"" like lisinopril, or ""sartan"" like valsartan) seem to be having a worse time. This makes sense since both of these classes of medicine affect cells in the lungs, which SARS CoV2 is thought to also affect.

The biggest danger right now, and the reason why I am writing this, and tagging you... is that this will ""explode"" here like it has in Italy, Iran and how it did in China.

We only have so many hospital beds. We only have so many ICU beds. We only have so many ventilators.. and we only have so many trained staff who can care for the patients. If this blows up massively beyond the ability of the health care system to treat and rescue patients, people who COULD have lived will simply die.

In italy they have an excellent national healthcare system with about 5000 ICU beds, and per capita have more doctors and hospital beds than we do here in the US. Of course, the US is bigger and has more total beds, and ventilators... but again.. less per capita. In italy, in Lombardy (the state/province) and in Milan... they have simply run out of ventilators. Doctors are faced with having too many people who cant breathe anymore, and not enough breathing machines to put them on. They are literally deciding on the spot who might live and who will die. They aren't doing CPR or anything else futile for the COVID patients. They dont have the staff or capacity to do so.

There's a lot more horrible stuff I could tell you about whats happening, but the short version is this - if we exceed the capacity to manage this, people who should have lived will die.

Which brings us to here, now, in the US. COVID is here. It WILL sweep the nation. There was never anything we could have done to stop it because of the way we live and conduct business. BUT what we have to do is SLOW IT DOWN.

IF we SLOW IT DOWN, so that the number of unwell and critically ill dont explode, and overwhelm the system, then everyone has a fighting chance. Give time for flu season to end and get flu patients out of the hospital. Give time for the first wave of Covid patients to get well enough to get out of the hospital.

So.. to SLOW IT DOWN... practice frequent handwashing. Dont touch your face, nose or eyes without washing your hands first. Frequently disinfect common surfaces.

PRACTICE SOCIAL DISTANCING. COVID LOVES A CROWD. If you are gonna spread this disease around lets spread it to only one or two people not 100 people at a time. Stay away from large groups. Lets lay off the rodeos, the ball games, the big parties, the night clubs. Do small groups.. or stay home. If you go out, and touch common surfaces, clean your hands before touching your face. On a bus in china, one person gave it to 8 other people, including one who got on 30 mins after the index case left the bus.

If you are sick, stay home. Dont visit other vulnerable folks. If it gets in your household, accept that its there and try not to give it to your aunts, uncles and grandparents. Stay home, dont go to school.

For the elders reading this. I need you to stay home as if your life depends on it. Because it very well does. Your age group is the one having the worst time with this. And if it gets bad, all I can say is that in Italy this week, if you were crashing and over 60, they didn't even consider offering a vent to them. So please, elders, Stay home, skip church, avoid visiting large numbers of people. Skip the lodge meeting . And if you are adamant that your wings will not be clipped, then please make sure your will is updated, and you've given a copy to your kids.

Now.. none of this says ""panic"" or ""buy bottled water and toilet paper"". I'm asking for everyone to take a deep breath and be smart.

Quit caring about your 401k. In a year or two it will be back. The airlines and cruise lines will get bailed out. The economy is going to tank no matter what, so quit worrying about it. Right now the decision is do we want a tanked economy with a low body count or a high body count.

We are all in this together. Wash your hands. Cover your mouth. Practice social distancing. Stay away from large crowds. Be smart. Stay home if sick. Dont hoard or steal medical supplies. We need them desperately at the hospital.",1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0

Singapore serves a model for other countries, say experts

PM Lee addressed the city in a video posted online Saturday


As governments in Asia struggle to reassure their populations over the coronavirus, public health experts say Singapore’s approach in communicating to the public is providing a model for others to reduce panic, rumors and conspiracy theories.

In a nine-minute recorded message on Sunday, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said “fear can do more harm than the virus itself” amid reports of long lines and hoarding at local supermarkets. He then laid out steps residents can take to help prevent the spread of the virus, like exercising good hygiene, while assuring them that the city had enough supplies of enough goods.

Moreover, he reassured Singaporeans that the virus didn’t appear as deadly as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in 2003, meaning that most people would likely experience a minor illness. He also said the government would change its approach if the virus became widespread to avoid overwhelming hospitals, adding he would keep them “informed every step of the way.”


The speech, posted on social media in three languages, appeared to have an immediate impact: The long queues at supermarkets throughout the city-state on Friday night returned to normal levels as of Sunday. That alone proved notable in a region where governments have struggled to get the message right, spurring panic buying and confusion over how to protect themselves from the outbreak.

Mixed Messages

In Hong Kong, leader Carrie Lam’s mixed messages on wearing masks and shutting the border with mainland China has stirred mistrust. Nurses have gone on strike and residents have violently opposed quarantine sites, while residents have struggled to buy toilet paper, hand sanitizer, rice and other staples for more than a week.

In Thailand, meanwhile, Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul issued an apology after saying foreigners should be “kicked out of Thailand” for refusing to wear face masks.

Singapore, which has 5.7 million people, has 45 confirmed cases of the virus. That’s the second-highest outside China, excluding a quarantined cruise ship off the coast of Japan.

Lee's speech “was a pretty outstanding example of very good risk communication,” said Claire Hooker, a senior lecturer at the University of Sydney’s Center for Values, Ethics and the Law in Medicine, who has studied the public responses to epidemics and infectious disease for about 20 years. “It gave people very concrete actions” that “handed back a measure of control to people whose sense of control will feel threatened,” she said.



Thomas Abraham, author of “Twenty First Century Plague, the Story of SARS,” and a risk communication consultant for the World Health Organization, said the speech worked because of the high level of trust Singaporeans have in the competence of the government -- as well as the transparency.

“Prime Minister Lee does not hide any facts,” Abraham said. “Nor does he hesitate to talk about how the situation might worsen.”

Singapore’s next general election must be held by April 2021, though the ruling party has called for early polls in recent cycles. It’s unclear how the coronavirus outbreak will affect the timing of the vote.

**Medical microbiologists: 'Information RIVM is behind and incomplete'**

If the Netherlands does not immediately pursue its efforts to curb the number of corona infections, the consequences will be incalculable. The Dutch Society for Medical Microbiology (NVMM) writes this in a letter to RIVM today, after the announcement of additional measures across the country. They call for ""military decisive structures"".

""Stoneware what the cabinet has now done, because this was necessary, "" said Professor Heiman Wertheim, board member of the NVMM. But it may not be enough. ""The situation is urgent. There must be good information. Because the problem is bigger. There is no idea who is in intensive care, who has been admitted, who has recovered and was fired healthy."" The organization wants to help RIVM with this.

The doctors have studied data of the virus from other sources and conclude that information on the RIVM site is ""seriously behind and incomplete"". ""The RIVM data give the impression that Brabant is not very different from Utrecht and that the increase in the number of cases is not that bad. We all know that this is not the case.""

**Drastic measures**

The doctors blame RIVM for not testing sufficiently for corona contacts. They also want RIVM to make the problems visible by making tables on the site with overviews of newly identified cases and suspicious (untested) cases, how many people have been admitted and are in intensive care and information about the number of deaths, recovered and tested cases.

The NVMM expects the Netherlands to follow the trend in Italy. ""Significant actions in Italy seem to have an effect now, but have started too late, as indicated by Italy,"" the letter said. The doctors write that not acting now will eventually lead to more damage. ""Only drastic measures in the initial phase can limit the risk for citizens.""

**Stay alert**

The doctors also want supplies for diagnosis to be centrally controlled and upgraded. ""There is now a shortage of nasal masks and protective equipment."" It is difficult to estimate whether the new measures are sufficient. ""It is important that the government has now taken important steps in measures. And it is important that we remain alert from now on.""

""Everyone must adhere to the announced new measures. And think carefully,"" says Wertheim. ""My best friend is celebrating his birthday and turning 50. I'm not going there and canceled it. My friend canceled his party.""",1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Take some of your most recent profits (I know this isn't easy to do) and use some of it to facilitate testing across the nation.  Set up testing sites at each of your arena's so anyone in the public can be tested (drive thru style).

I have to believe this could be facilitated by very few doctors per location and training the every-day capable citizen could be done quickly to carry out the procedure or very capable nurses could help out.  It is not rocket science to swab someone's mouth, nose, etc... but you do need to be very careful about not getting sick yourself or others.

I would happily donate to this cause as well, just announce it and you have my donation.  Isn't it odd that there has been no ""donate $10 to help stop COVID-19"" yet?  I would gladly donate simply to help someone else pay for their testing if it is going to save lives and help stop the spread.

93,"What is a Virus? Scientists at USAMRID, the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious diseases, work with some of the most deadly forms of life on earth, killer viruses. Learn more.

Some viruses are picky about which door they choose, but others are a little more promiscuous. “They can very easily penetrate into all types of cells,” says Anna Suk-Fong Lok, assistant dean for clinical research at the University of Michigan Medical School and former president of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.

Both SARS and MERS viruses can access the cells that line your intestines and large and small colon, and those infections appear to flourish in the gut, potentially causing the damage or the leakage of fluid that becomes diarrhea.

But Frieman says we don’t know yet if the novel coronavirus does the same. Researchers believe COVID-19 uses the same receptor as SARS, and this doorway can be found in your lungs and small intestines.

Two studies—one in the New England Journal of Medicine and one preprint in medRxiv involving 1,099 cases—have also detected the virus in stool samples, which might indicate the virus could spread via feces. But this is far from conclusive.

“Whether that kind of fecal transmission is occuring for this Wuhan virus, we don’t know at all,” Frieman says. “But it definitely looks like it’s there in the stool and it looks like people do have GI symptoms associated with this.”

Blood storm

Coronaviruses can also cause problems in other systems of the body, due to the hyperactive immune response we mentioned earlier.

A 2014 study showed that 92 percent of patients with MERS had at least one manifestation of the coronavirus outside of the lungs. In fact, signs of a full body blitz have been witnessed with all three of the zoonotic coronaviruses: elevated liver enzymes, lower white blood cell and platelet count, and low blood pressure. In rare cases, patients have suffered from acute kidney injury and cardiac arrest.

But this isn’t necessarily a sign that the virus itself is spreading throughout the body, says Angela Rasmussen, a virologist and associate research scientist at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. It might be a cytokine storm.

   Basically you’re bleeding out of your blood vessels.

Angela Rasmussen, virologist

Cytokines are proteins used by the immune system as alarm beacons—they recruit immune cells to the site of infection. The immune cells then kill off the infected tissue in a bid to save the rest of the body.

Humans rely on our immune systems to keep their cool when facing a threat. But during a runaway coronavirus infection, when the immune system dumps cytokines into the lungs without any regulation, this culling becomes a free-for-all, Rasmussen says “Instead of shooting at a target with a gun, you’re using a missile launcher,” she says. That’s where the problem arises: Your body is not just targeting the infected cells. It is attacking healthy tissue too.

The implications extend outside the lungs. Cytokine storms create inflammation that weakens blood vessels in the lungs and causes fluid to seep through to the air sacs. “Basically you’re bleeding out of your blood vessels,” Rasmussen says. The storm spills into your circulatory system and creates systemic issues across multiple organs.

From there, things can take a sharp turn for the worse. In some of the most severe COVID-19 cases, the cytokine response—combined with a diminished capacity to pump oxygen to the rest of the body—can result in multi-organ failure. Scientists don’t know exactly why some patients experience complications outside of the lung, but it might be linked to underlying conditions like heart disease or diabetes.

“Even if the virus doesn’t get to kidneys and liver and spleen and other things, it can have clear downstream effects on all of those processes,” Frieman says. And that’s when things can get serious.

Liver: Collateral damage

When a zoonotic coronavirus spreads from the respiratory system, your liver is often one downstream organ that suffers. Doctors have seen indications of liver injury with SARS, MERS, and COVID-19—often mild, though more severe cases have led to severe liver damage and even liver failure. So what’s happening?

“Once a virus gets into your bloodstream, they can swim to any part of your body,” Lok says. “The liver is a very vascular organ so \[a coronavirus\] can very easily get into your liver.”

Your liver works pretty hard to make sure your body can function properly. Its main job is to process your blood after it leaves the stomach, filtering out the toxins and creating nutrients your body can use. It also makes the bile that helps your small intestine break down fats. Your liver also contains enzymes, which speed up chemical reactions in the body.

In a normal body, Lok explains, liver cells are constantly dying off and releasing enzymes into your bloodstream. This resourceful organ then quickly regenerates new cells and carries on with its day. Because of that regeneration process, the liver can withstand a lot of injury.

When you have abnormally high levels of enzymes in your blood, though—as has been a common characteristic of patients suffering from SARS and MERS—it’s a warning sign. It might be a mild injury that the liver will quickly bounce back from or it could be something more severe—even liver failure.

Lok says scientists don’t completely understand how these respiratory viruses behave in the liver. The virus might be directly infecting the liver, replicating and killing off the cells itself. Or those cells might be collateral damage as your body’s immune response to the virus sets off a severe inflammatory reaction in the liver.",0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0
94,"If supportive care alone isn’t sufficient, then experimental use of these drugs is the common treatment right now. 
Sometimes alone, more often in combination from the research I have been reading. 

With the already approved drugs used off label to treat COVID-19 all that is required is patient or patient proxy consent as the drugs are already approved for medical use. 
Most will also be asked (sometimes retrospectively) if their case data can be used as part of clinical trial data for use in analysis later which can then become part of the body of evidence that these drugs are indeed effective. 
What will currently be lacking is the size of the control group, the severely with COVID-19 that may benefit from these drugs but are not given them, mostly patient refusal currently as currently if your only option is Chloroquine and Supportive ICU care or very likely worsening disease and death, most consent to Chloroquine even though it isn’t approved for that indication and the evidence for safety and efficient is not as large (as yet) as would be normally needed for approval. 

For unapproved drugs like Remdesivir, compassionate use authorisation and consent are needed making its use much less common as there isn’t a great supply of it and qualifying for compassionate use requires meeting a set of criteria that not everyone that may benefit from it can meet. 

Anything saying ‘90% success rate’ should not be taken as confirmatory proof of efficacy. Samples are still to small and those sort of statements would have to be combined with what sort of condition the patients treated were in to begin with.   
And also no, it doesn’t mean that we’re saving 90% of COVID patients because of the 90% efficacy of some drug treatment - it also is not in any way connected to the published rate of cases being classed as severe nor those ending in death vs recovery. 

Any paper regarding a specified drug treatment for COVID right now is simply communicating how cases progressed when these drugs were used. 
They don’t indicate that the drugs were curative or disease modifying as there is no way to determine how many of the patients treated experimentally with drugs would not have recovered spontaneously. 
However the more examples of cases you collect with patients in similar conditions where the group treated had a lower mortality rate than the group given no antiviral drugs adds to the body of evidence for the specified drugs that they were partly responsible for that lower mortality rate (should it be lower). 

And as with all scientific literature, there are biases. Particularly when a problem needs a solution as quickly as possible. 
There is more pressure to publish when the report can be written presenting data as showing that the experimental drug treatments lessened disease length and/or severity, reduced morbidity and/or mortality and even very low sample size case reports of one or two critically ill COVID-19, ventilator/ECMO dependent patients being brought back from the bring of death very rapidly once drug treatment was initiated. 
So you’ll see a lot of positive confirmation bias around drugs that do have an positive effect against SARS-CoV2. 
It’s not the best science, but it’s not totally without use and until better double blind controlled trials are available (which can be partially completed during the outbreak with severe restriction on control groups and the double blinding); it’s these case reports that are guiding the production of preliminary treatment protocols all around the world. 
Read any country’s current guidelines for pharmacotherapy in COVID-19 and you’ll see referenced case reports of low numbers of patients given Chloroquine and Kaletra while in the ICU on renal replacement and ventilated rather than large controlled trials also including healthy controls as that’s mainly all we currently have. So these positive outcomes shouldn’t be ignored but their guiding of treatment for large groups will be replaced with better studies once available which will also provide better evidence as to the efficacy of these drugs and the rates of efficacy such as something that resembles a ‘success rate’ - 

Data from better trials will show differences between drug treated and untreated COVID patients (if they exist for a particular drug treatment) 
They will include many more data points/large sample sizes such as differences in mortality rates, rate of reduction of viral load (viral load vs time in treated and untreated), CRP level vs time in treated and untreated patients. 
Other trends may be present which one may be able to find from larger studies such as differences in drug efficacy between age groups, sex, combined with other drugs, combined with comorbidities. 
Statistical analysis of the data will then allow reports to be produced to show if and how significant the changes to the measured and recorded clinical attributes (blood results, data obtained upon physical examination etc) are. 
Do this correctly, and in a manner that can be repeated, and you build a body of evidence for a particular drug treatment that increases confidence that a correlation between improvement in clinical condition and use of a new drug regiment is indicative of a causation.

With all the clinical data present, a probable confirmation on the downstream effects of a mechanism of action - if you know from in vitro work that a drug inhibits an enzyme required for viral replication and patients that receive it have their viral load inversely correlated with time using of the drug and the rate of decrease is much greater in patients using the drug you start to build a better quantitative picture of efficacy as one example. You can also use these data combined with drug dose given as an independent variable in order to determine the optimal dose for each age group or minimal dose required to treat which could be (and very probably is) different for COVID than malaria. 

So be very wary of wide reaching statements during this early stage especially those that state things like cure and success rates with no explanation of how that number was calculated and from data from what sample of patients were used to generate it and the number in that sample and of course whether the process has been peer reviewed and repeated by other medics/scientists/healthcare providers. 

TL;DR - Use of these drugs experimentally is already common in severe cases as it’s all we have to use, there aren’t yet any specific SARS-CoV2 antiviral drugs. 
90% success rate with a drug doesn’t mean that we are currently saving 90% of patients with COVID-19 because of that drug. 
There is not yet enough data to provide any ‘success rate’ type statistics or even change in mortality rate statistics for any drug used in COVID-19 patients but there are many interesting and encouraging case reports where drugs have been used against SARS-CoV2 which are being used to generate preliminary guidelines for clinical practice and will guide the construction of larger current and future studies that will show how confident we can be that any of these treatments can be relied upon to treat COVID-19 and then which are better than others by comparing different drug treatments that all positively treat the disease with each other. 
Then we will have evidence for which treatments work, the correct doses to use, which are most toxic/have more side effects, which are more or less appropriate in special populations (in pregnancy, users of other meds etc) and in which cases a drug treatment is effective against the disease in some cases (those currently classed as ‘severe’ for example, something else we need a universal definition for) but didn’t statistically significantly change the outcome in others, ie when use of antiviral drug treatment (which does work) is required or appropriate at all. 

I’ve probably missed a lot out, but there some useful info in there. One could write (and there exist many) large texts on how to construct and run a clinical trial that produces high enough quantity and quality data that can be used to produce evidence to guide clinical practice. 
You also get the picture of why it all takes much time, financial investment and dedicated personnel to do correctly. Drugs are very expensive because of profiteering, but they’re normally expensive and time consuming to discover and prove safe and effective because of all the above and more.",0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0

I had tried to push down that all-too-familiar lump that rises in my throat before the tears began, but a mix of hormones and coronavirus-induced anxiety proved too much.
My colleagues at The Times have written extensively about the apprehension surrounding the outbreak, including people flocking to stores to stockpile food and other essentials. So when my husband and I walked into the store that day, we expected certain aisles would be empty. I didn’t anticipate nearly all the infant Tylenol would be gone.
In a complete panic, but still months away from my due date, I picked up one of the last boxes on the shelf in an attempt to find some sense of control.
My husband looked at me with confusion as I unleashed a string of irrational fears. He countered, kindly, that perhaps the medicine should be saved for a family with a sick baby at home. Of course, he was right. I pictured a panicked new mother searching for medication for her child and finding none among the sea of empty shelves. I put the box back.

If I become infected with the coronavirus, what are my odds of survival?

March 19, 2020

Dr. Neil Silverman, a clinical professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, has heard similar questions at his practice from many worried mothers-to-be.
“It’s all about the fact that there’s so many things in the setting of a pregnancy that women have no control over,” Silverman said during a recent phone interview. “Women, especially in their first pregnancy, are understandably concerned in general about all the things that cannot go according to plan.”
There is little data available on how the coronavirus, which causes a respiratory illness known as COVID-19, affects pregnant women. Women experience physiological changes during pregnancy that can weaken their immune systems and place them at higher risk for severe complications if exposed to viruses, especially if they have underlying heath conditions.
Past studies have shown that pregnant women who contract influenza are at higher risk for severe complications, and in 2009, women who contracted H1N1 — the swine flu — during pregnancy also became sicker than non-pregnant women, according to Dr. Denise Jamieson, chair of the department of gynecology and obstetrics at the Emory University School of Medicine in Georgia.
Still, doctors said that researchers have not seen early signals suggesting an increased risk of complications or birth defects associated with pregnant women and fetuses exposed to the coronavirus.
“Pregnant women can become severely ill, but I think pregnant women should be reassured as there doesn’t seem to be related birth defects like we saw with Zika,” Jamieson said during a phone call last week. “These are scary times, and I think a lot of people, including pregnant women, are afraid. Luckily this is not a virus that seems to disproportionately affect pregnant women. They can take solace in that.”

In a recent study published in the Lancet, researchers followed nine pregnant women who had tested positive for the novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China — the epicenter of the outbreak — during their third trimester. Researchers found that none of the infants, all delivered via caesarean, had the virus at birth. There also was no evidence of the virus in the mothers’ breast milk, cord blood or amniotic fluid, according to the study.
The new mothers had experienced the same symptoms as nonpregnant women, the study showed, with fever in seven, cough in four, myalgia in three and sore throat and malaise in two. They developed pneumonia, but none of the cases were considered severe.
Researchers suggest these data indicate that mothers diagnosed with COVID-19 do not pass along the virus to their unborn babies through the placenta. However, it is possible for mothers to pass the virus to infants after birth from respiratory droplets or particles that leave the mouth or nose when a sick person coughs, sneezes or talks.
While the virus has not been detected in breast milk, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it’s still not clear whether the virus can be transmitted to infants during feedings. The CDC recommends infected mothers wash their hands before touching their babies and wearing a face mask, if possible, while breastfeeding. Another option is having a healthy person feed expressed breast milk to the infant.
Health officials are urging pregnant women, along with the elderly and others with weakened immune systems, to do their best to avoid exposure to the coronavirus. Doctors suggest staying home as much as possible, avoiding crowds — including long lines at supermarkets and other stores — and staying away from emergency rooms. And, of course, frequent hand washing.

Dr. Karin Nielsen-Saines, professor of clinical pediatrics in the Division of Infectious Diseases at UCLA Children’s Hospital, suggests women reach out to their doctors to see if routine labs or physical assessments can be done without a visit to clinics or hospitals to limit their risk of exposure.
Some doctors, including mine, have already instituted this practice. The Kaiser Permanente in Gardena was nearly empty when I arrived Wednesday afternoon for a monthly exam and ultrasound. Medical staff wearing paper gowns, masks and gloves screened patients for symptoms of the virus before they walked in the front door.

I was one of a few people that day who had to physically visit the office because I had to have blood drawn.
“Get in and out quickly,” a nurse told me as she placed a sticker allowing my entry into the building on my blouse.
Another woman who was having an ultrasound was video-chatting with her husband, who was stuck in the lobby, during the exam. The medical center has stopped allowing visitors in exam rooms in an effort to help protect patients and staff members from the spread of the illness.
A similar visitor policy also extends to hospitals when women are giving birth. Kaiser will allow one visitor, typically a spouse or partner, for the duration of a woman’s hospital stay. But family and friends are being asked to wait until the new parents are at home to meet their bundle of joy. Hoag Hospital in Orange County has also instituted the one-visitor policy.
Despite the new restrictions and disappointments — especially for women whose baby shower plans and “babymoon” trips have been thwarted by the virus — Nielsen-Saines emphasized the importance of keeping to a routine, even during times of uncertainty.
“Exercise, talk with friends, try to keep a sense of normalcy,” she told me. “This feeling of impending doom doesn’t help anyone. It’s important to keep it all in perspective.”

The coronavirus crisis has escalated this Friday to several levels in Italy. Fourteen people tested positive in the town of Codogno, southeast of Milan, and two others in Padua, in the Veneto region, according to the latest information. These are the first known cases of transmission by contagion of this disease in the country. This situation has led to the compulsory quarantine of about 250 people and the isolation of ten neighbouring towns with a total of about 47,500 inhabitants. In addition, the regional government has forced the closure of all public premises and has recommended that the inhabitants do not leave their homes in the next few hours. The medical alarm has also been triggered by the lack of clarity regarding the source of the infection and the epidemiological link that would allow the disease to be isolated.

&amp;#x200B;

The first case detected was that of a 38-year-old Italian man from Castiglione d'Adda. The patient was hospitalised on Wednesday, but initially no clear connection to China was established and it was ruled out that the symptoms could be related to the disease. When his situation worsened and he had to be transferred to the intensive care unit, his wife gave the alert that activated the protocol: the man had met several times with a friend who had recently returned from China. But the clue was more puzzling.

&amp;#x200B;

The meetings between the two occurred many more days after his return from the Asian country. More than the 14 that establish the duration of the incubation process and that could hide the symptoms. In addition, when the potential carrier of the virus was tested, he tested negative. The man remains hospitalized for further testing, but he never had any symptoms and if he actually contracted the virus, his infection could be over by now, health authorities suggested. The worst-case scenario, hence the alarm raised in the region, is that the epidemiological link would have been lost.

&amp;#x200B;

The wife, who is eight months pregnant, was one of those who tested positive for the coronavirus, as was a man who had played sports with it. The rest of the infections did not, in principle, have direct contact with the 38-year-old man. Three customers from a bar in Codogno, the main focus of the infection in Lombardy, all arrived at the local hospital between Thursday and Friday night with significant cases of pneumonia, which made it possible to detect the positives. ""The patients are men and women, all around 40 years old. The only thing we know is that they all live in the same area,"" said Giulio Gallera, regional health coordinator. However, eight other people in Lombardy were added to the list of infections, including five doctors and three patients from the Codogno hospital where the first people to contract the virus were treated.

&amp;#x200B;

The environment of the man who was first infected has been isolated. The patient works at an Italian branch of Unilever, while the friend who made the trip to China is a manager at MAE, an Italian producer of synthetic fibres. Among those who should be quarantined are the 38-year-old's co-workers, family members and the doctors and nurses who treated him in the hospital. The emergency room that initially treated the 38-year-old man has also been closed.

&amp;#x200B;

The regional government has decided to close schools, administrative buildings and bars and restaurants in ten villages for one week. In addition, it has asked people not to leave their homes. ""It is necessary to immediately isolate the areas where the virus has developed in order to contain it,"" said Lombardy Civil Protection Commissioner Pietro Foroni. ""We must not spread panic, but we must make people understand that the measures taken are essential for the good of the community,"" said Lombardy President Attilio Fontana. Health Minister Roberto Speranza and the head of the National Civil Protection Agency, Angelo Borrelli, went to Lombardy this afternoon for a crisis meeting with local authorities.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
97,"On Day 1 of Lockdown, Italian Officials Urge Citizens to Abide by Rules

Italy’s prime minister implored the public to cooperate in the largest clampdown against the coronavirus in the Western world. “We are the new Wuhan,” one Milan resident said.

A broad lockdown has begun in Italy in response to the coronavirus, which included tourist attractions shutting down and a virtual mass from Pope Francis.

By Jason Horowitz and Emma Bubola
Published March 8, 2020
Updated March 9, 2020, 12:04 p.m. ET

ROME — Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte ended his 2:15 a.m. news conference to announce the extraordinary lockdown of Italy’s north with a plea that other heads of state may not have felt compelled to make.

“We must understand that we all must stick to and we must not counteract these measures,” he urged in the early hours of Sunday morning. “We must not try and be clever.”

Mr. Conte had just decreed a series of measures that amounted to the largest clampdown against the coronavirus outbreak in the Western world, restricting the movement of about a quarter of Italy's population and jeopardizing its economy.

But unlike China, where the outbreak began, this is a democracy, and debate erupted immediately over how well the government will be able to enforce the new rules — and whether Italians will actually obey them.

“We are the new Wuhan,” said Elena Lofino, 39, who works in a shopping center in the closed-off northern region of Lombardy, referring to the locked-down Chinese city of 11 million people where the virus is believed to have originated.

As she hung out with her friends, Ms. Lofino said she thought the measures made sense. “It’s going to be a huge sacrifice,” she said, “but we’ll accept it.”

By The New York Times
Hours after the prime minister announced the new restrictions, Italy’s death toll from the virus jumped by more than 50 percent in a single day to 366 from 233 on Saturday — the most deaths officially reported for any country outside China. Italy has the worst outbreak in Europe, with more than 7,300 known to be infected.

Many, including Mr. Conte, have appealed to Italians to reject their tendency toward “furbizia,” the Italian word for the sort of cunning or cleverness typically channeled into getting around bureaucracy and inconvenient laws.

Furbizia, to be sure, is a broad-brush character trait ascribed to Italians, often by other Italians.

But on Sunday, it seemed to be front of mind as travelers rushed onto trains out of Lombardy before the decree went into effect in the afternoon and as health experts and officials implored the public to abide by the law and act responsibly.

“You need to stay home!” Barbara Balanzoni, a doctor, said in a video that went viral in Italy. She said there were not enough respirators to help people sick from the virus.

“There are too many people walking around,” Dr. Balanzoni protested.

As museums closed across the country, Italy’s culture minister, Dario Franceschini, thanked “the many protagonists of music, cinema, and show business” who promoted on social media the “I’m Staying Home” hashtag.

“It’s a very important message for our youth,” he wrote on Twitter.

In Rome, outside the locked-down “red zones” farther north, the authorities recommended that people limit their movements to only what is “strictly necessary.” Valeria Graziussi, a Neapolitan living in Rome, said she and her friends had decided to “do an experiment.”

On Sunday, she went for an afternoon coffee at the Café Sant’Eustachio, one of the city’s best-known cafes, which is usually packed. “You rarely get to stand at the counter for more than 30 seconds,” she said.

Ms. Graziussi still found lines to get served at the counter, and so considered the experiment a success.

“We haven’t been terrorized enough,” her friend Davide d’Andrea said with a shrug.

The Italian authorities have consistently taken some of the most aggressive steps to stop the virus’s spread. They have canceled flights from China in January, quarantining entire towns in February and now severely limiting movement in all of Lombardy — home to the economic powerhouse Milan — as well as in swaths of other nearby regions and iconic cities like Venice.

That has not been enough for some European officials. The Czech prime minister, Andrej Babis, said on Sunday that Italy should ban all its citizens from traveling to Europe.

In Italy, critics said the calls for civic duty were undercut by confusion.

They said that contradictory messages from the government and from officials of the northern regions about what people could do and where they could go were not helping. They also criticized the national government in Rome for a schizophrenia that vacillates between drop-everything alerts and just-wash-your-hands reassurances.

While Prime Minister Conte said Italians were “obligated” to stay put in the demarcated northern areas unless they had been granted permission to pass through police checkpoints, the Lombardy official running the region’s response to the crisis said it was not so strict.

Giulio Gallera, the Lombardy region’s top health care official, said in a Facebook live post that the decree signed overnight by Mr. Conte had fostered “doubts” among citizens. Mr. Gallera suggested that citizens, to preserve the country’s economy, should be able to move around for work. And he said the national government should clear up any confusion on the matter.

Matteo Salvini, the leader of Italy’s opposition league party, echoed the sentiment.

“Clarity, clarity, clarity!” he said in a statement. “Who can do what? Where can you go? What can you bring?”

In the days before the decree, old men outside the quarantined town Zorlesco joked that their friends often sidestepped the rules and eluded the police checkpoints by taking old country roads to the bar for a drink outside the locked-down area.

In the country’s southern regions, the governors say that anyone arriving from locked- down northern areas should go into quarantine.

Giuseppe Ippolito, the director of the Lazzaro Spallanzani National Institute for Infectious Diseases in Rome, declared on Italian television that “the people who fled last night are a potential risk for the country.” He urged them to contact the health services, report their situation and “be ready for eventual isolation.”

Some people thought they were doing the right thing by leaving Milan for the south.

At Milan’s Central train station early Sunday morning, Giorgia Caredda, a 30-year-old social media manager, waited for a train to Rome so that she could help take care of her father, who has heart problems, “in case something bad happens.”

“One side of me feels really silly” she said about being prompted to leave by a sense of impending doom. “I got this sensation of being chained and needed to get out.”

The authorities in the Lazio region, where the regional president on Saturday said he had contracted the virus, posted on Facebook pictures of busy squares and streets in Rome with a #wecantdothis caption.

In Luigi Barzini’s 1964 classic study of his countrymen, “The Italians,” he attributed the value put on furbizia to Italy’s habit of being conquered and governed by a long line of hated foreigners or quislings, from Napoleon to the Hapsburgs.

“Under the surface the Italians invented ways to defeat oppressive regimentation,” Mr. Barzini wrote. “As they could not protect their national liberty in the field of battle, they fought strenuously to defend the liberty of the individual and his family, the only liberty they understood anyway.”

The writer compared the rules those leaders imposed to “the hedges in a steeplechase course” that Italians used to show off their speed. Laws, he said, became a necessary evil if only because they provided the delight of evading them.

“How could one circumvent laws if there were none?” he wrote.

This is precisely the kind of thinking that Mr. Conte urged Italians to avoid.

“We must safeguard our health,” he said early Sunday, “and that of those we love.”

In some unlikely quarters, that message seemed to be breaking through.

Antonio Ponti, 47, a D.J. in Milan’s club scene, had planned a party in defiance of the crackdown on the city’s night life. To skirt an ordinance against events in venues that don’t allow people to keep a meter’s distance from one another, he cleverly planned the party outdoors.

But as the toll of virus grew, and talk of tough restrictions resonated in Milan, he said he did not  want to be seen as a “plague spreader.” He followed the lead of other promoters and pulled the plug.

“It is wiser,” he said, “if we help things get better.”

There are policy pathways that would get there though, they would however cause harm elsewhere.. So it's entirely possible, just almost certainly not desirable.

&gt;Which they already have under the EU tariff schedule. 

No, the EU tariff schedule covers a lot of different elements and is used to protect a slew of producers within the EU that the UK does not need to protect as it doesn't have those producers.. Moreover, the EU has traditionally been able to leverage the size of the UK market, but has been poor at either delivering on things like service access, and indeed slow to push the single market in services (which is why it is incomplete...).  Even things like the measures taken against the swiss on equivalence were leveraging UK markets to push a political agenda that the UK didn't particularly support..

&gt;Not convinced at all that being able to fiddle with this will make for any of the damage whatsoever.

It'll mitigate some of the issue caused by the loss of membership, it isn't supposed to make up for it (there is no better economic relationship with the EU than membership of the EU..) but then this isn't a purely economic issue.

&gt;No I think what I said was more accurate, prices were going down and then stopped going down mid 2016.

It's accurate if you ignore anything before 2016, which paints a pretty poor picture, and again, the summary from the linked document gives a much clearer view.

&gt;Since then it's been more or less level (I'd say that looks a slight increase) thanks to the fact we haven't actually left yet . I'm sure this years data will be worthless due to COVID19.

Again, we have the data, it reflects what people are actually spending on actual goods... Trying to take a snapshot to fit a narriative, or dismissing data isn't helpful in getting a clear picture of the impact. 

&gt;Probably thanks to the price of oil, I actually checked France and Germany and their food price inflation numbers are broadly similar.

Right... There are lots of factors, but the outcome is still the same (and oil prices are crashing, so we could see a reduction in food prices, supermarkets are having to compete, that previously led to a crash in food prices, we are going to see a re-evaluation of supply chains, that could also lead to a drop in pricing..).  The likely outcome is a mild increase above inflation, but there are a massive number of factors.

&gt;I can't seem to find the figures for real terms price changes for them though so it's hard to say if our prices have risen compared to theirs.

IIRC ours have risen faster in real terms than Germany, slower in real terms than France.

&gt;I'd be interested to see if their fall in prices and then the levelling off lines up with ours.

It doesn't because of a number of factors, including both the currency issues in the UK and political issues in France that have had an economic knock on and a couple of other elements IIRC.",0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0
101,"What do we do with these conflicts?

It's very tempting to ignore them. Let the latest round of religious violence sort itself out, see what fanatical dictator emerges, and bribe him to get some of that tasty oil. We can pat ourselves on the back, because this time we didn't get involved in local politics that weren't our business, and we let those third world folks choose their own form of government and figure things out for themselves. Nobody has to feel guilty about drone strikes, or get called arrogant, because we held ourselves above the conflict (which is of course just as arrogant as wading in thinking you can fix everything, but at least you don't get *called* arrogant for disdaining to act).

Yet then come all the distressing reports during the violent times of genocides, chemical warfare, sex trafficking, slavery, mass killings, torture, etc. etc. etc., of all the old Sectarian hatreds flaring up until the region is engulfed in a war of everyone versus everyone. And you do kind of have to wonder how history is going to look back on the world that saw all this shit going down and shrugged, apathetic, pausing only to ask when the oil would resume flowing. And you have to ask yourself how long it'll be before someone looks outward for an enemy, one that could unite a lot of people under his or her war banner. And you have the floods of refugees who're going to want to escape to safer countries as long as there's a war on, whether or not the West is staying out of it - maybe that'll be good for the economy, maybe not. We'll have to see on that one. Point is, there're compelling reasons to want to promote stability in the region, which means intervening in some way.

But how do you stop a conflict like the endless Middle Eastern clusterfuck, in which each war is only the latest in a long series of battles? Well, an Iraqi friend once told me that his personal plan for Peace in the Mid East was to, and I quote, ""glass everything."" True, he may have played too much WH40k for his own good, but it does kind of sum up what a Gordian knot the whole mess is, and how tempting it is to want a magic bullet (or Alexander the Great's sword) to solve all the problems - a simple, direct solution. Well, frankly, if you're expecting someone on Reddit to have even a *complicated* perfect answer, you're probably deluding yourself.

For instance: the idea of education as a miracle cure for radicalism. You begin to build a school; Islamists militants shoot at you. Boko Haram. The school is done; Islamists shoot at it. Kids come; Islamists shoot at them, pour acid on them, kidnap and rape them. Kids stop coming; Islamists continue to shoot at the school. Nobody is getting educated; Islamists continue to shoot things. Okay, well, maybe bring in some soldiers to go raid the Islamists, let the kids feel safe coming to learn. It works, they're dead, good job. But each one has five brothers and thirty cousins in and around the valley who now maybe want to shoot at you; several of them are the same age as your students, but you don't have to be 18 to wear a suicide vest. Now - I hear that this eventually began to work in Afghanistan, but I'm not sure that means it would work throughout the region as a whole, because it's not as simple as Westerners versus Islamists with peace-loving folks caught in the middle, not when you expand your scope to the whole Middle East.

There're too many fuckin' cooks, you see. To solve the Middle East as a whole, you'd have to deal with a whole shitton of different factions that have been trying to wipe one another out for centuries, and none of them really like you that much - they'll use you when you're convenient, and use their death squads when you aren't. And then of course you have Israel sitting there, hoping desperately that none of these bastards ever wield influence or buddy up long enough to take a swing at them - and maybe Israel isn't relying solely on *hope*, either. Also, it's political suicide to cross them because they spend a king's ransom on buying your representatives' loyalty. Also, they can't help but piss off everyone in the region. Meanwhile, Russia is nosing around for any old scraps of Soviet glory they might've left behind the last time they were in the Middle East (you know, before Rambo kicked them out with the help of the brave Mujaheddin). Meanwhile, your soldiers and aid workers are being killed and the public is getting sick of apparently shoveling good money after bad to no obvious effect. Meanwhile, there's another genocide happening in Africa. Meanwhile, North Korea finally worked up the balls to start a nuclear war. Meanwhile, China and Japan are sniping at each other and threatening an islandhopping campaign, and it looks like South Korea wants in, too, assuming it's not still fighting North Korea. Meanwhile, Eastern Europe caught on fire again. Meanwhile, Mexico just became a police state/cartel state/both. Meanwhile, Canada's maple syrup reserves went missing. Meanwhile, we are giving serious thought to establishing a colony on Mars in the near future, and what will the Russians think of *that?* Meanwhile, Australia opened up its first literal death camp for immigrants and doesn't see what all the fuss is about. Meanwhile, Shi'ite and Sunni refugees from the endless war in the Middle East are demanding housing in separate districts, because they've been in a peaceful country for a while and have remembered old grudges. Meanwhile, global warming is displacing millions of coastal- and island-dwelling peoples, killing crops, and ravaging small economies. Meanwhile, increased automation in the workforce has predictably done nothing but line the pockets of the ultrawealthy, and unemployment is skyrocketing. Meanwhile, Kanye West just became the POTUS. Meanwhile, everyone's too distracted by the latest round of culture wars to summon up the political will to deal with anything but whether or not gendering characters in assigned reading is transmisogynistic. Meanwhile, the fucking neo-Nazis are back, and they're mainstream now. Meanwhile, all of Los Angeles just fell into the Pacific Ocean. Meanwhile, scandals. Meanwhile, bird flu and swine flu, hurricanes and meltdowns. Malaria and polio resurgence. AI research. Red carpet gaffs. Firefly reboot. Steam goes offline. SOPA and PIPA and the TPPIPPIPITTPIPI. Ice-nine.

There will always be other things to worry about, and even America doesn't have the resources or will to do it all. America probably doesn't have the resources to even hold the whole Middle East for an entire generation's worth of education (and I say ""even"" like that'd be such a small feat, when it'd be anything but).

Until people decide to stop killing one another, the killing will continue. That is the only simple truth, and it is pretty much worthless because, if history is anything to go by, we quite like killing one another - or at least we always forget that we hate it. And what's more, everything in this post is a horrifying oversimplification. Because, again, you're fuckin' nuts if you think someone on Reddit is slinging anything but snake oil.

He got sick within a week. We thought it was a normal cough/flu, but it was somehow different. Half of his class was out by then

On January 25th my wife was reading our kids (we have a 3 y/o too) bedtime stories and Henry started struggling to breathe. Then he just stopped. Totally clogged up

I grabbed him and stood him up in the middle of the room and was hitting his back to shake whatever was blocking his breathing. He was drowning in front of us. I squeezed his chest to try and just force pressure and he coughed up a bunch of mucus and started breathing again

It was terrifying. I took him to the emergency room and they checked him out. Told me he seemed ok and to “keep him close and monitor him”. I asked if it could be related to what is happening in Wuhan and they looked at me like I was crazy. He wasn’t tested (again this was January 25). I slept in bed with him and checked him every 15 minutes overnight. We’d run out of ibuprofen and had moved on to Tylenol. He recovered a few days later

104,"NO.... this is what the guy is REALLY trying to say. What's going on is that people who aren't infected by the virus and rather just the normal flu-turned penumonia patients are blindly taken out by force along with all the ""virus-turned' penumonia patients. He's trying say that the recoverying rate is A LOT higher than the amount of people taken away (200+ a day), since they have only 200 capacity, it's cleaned out daily. that's just 1 hospital. He kept mentioning that once they are taken, they do NOT return. Meaning that they'er literally shoving everyone into the fukcking new ""hospital"" (it's not, it's a death camp. look at any pics posted of the inside of th hospital. ALL BEDS. NOT 1 bed has a fucking IV. THey'are all death beds bro) which mean. This guy also said. The usual rate hes seen of people recovering is about 50% ,but it don't matter bcus the army is grabbing 100% of all patients in the hospital. Regardless if they're infected or not, and regardless if they're in the process of actually recoverying, and regardless of ANY chance to recover, they all taken way. meaning, eventually, they all die. becuase the place they're taken to, literally has NOTHING. there's no media coverage on this because this is inside info from my relative's close friend's grandpa who is locked inside the new hospital they just built. and they literally have been eating CRACKERS 3 fuking meals a day. with little water. they're trying so hard to get someone who knows someone who has some kinda political power to bring some food to the grapna. and this is for everyone who's in the hospital. Also, by the way, inside that hospital, there is NO  doorknob on the inside. Only outside. Meaning you go in and die in there, you dont come out. They caculated, all the creamtories in WUhan has been burning bodies 24hours a day. Just going by math, that's 1000 a day burnt just INSIDE the facilities. PLUS, they have started burning bodies on the outside, the area is HUGe apparently, and can be seen far away espeically at night becuase of the [fire.](https://fire.NO) Just straight burning bodies on the ground. So adding that into the equation, it's estimated 2000+ people dies  each day, not including the bodies that's laying around overtime because there's no more places to burn. the whole city is now covered in nasty thick fog, and the fog has a very distinct smell. That's from the burnt bodies. Not trying to scare yall, but the real estimate, taking everything I said in mind, caculated by inside people, and strictly covered up every where fucking where, i think even the US is covering it up  because we can't""afford to create panic"". Here's the number..The realistic death toll s now 100,000+  (One hundred thousand plus) but remember, lots of people aren't actually infected...are dragged into that pile.

105,"You're being highly imprecise with the phrase ""a bunch"" 

Oh, and 5-15k is absolutely a huge amount to be able to invest in the right stocks. What matters is the % return on investment, not the # of shares. Buying 1 share of Amazon for $2000 is better than buying 500 shares of some other stock with a lower price **if** that stock happens to be complete shit. Buying 1 share of AAPL for $300 is better than not buying anything during a buying opportunity like this. You do not need **a bunch** of money. You just need the amount that 1 share of a good stock costs. 

Also, you're pulling #s out of your ass. ""Even someone with $100k in their account will likely only have 5-15k in cash"" really? How do you know? Also, did you know that one can easily turn 15k into 60k or even 100k if they make a long term investment in a very strong stock at one of these rare highly obvious buying opportunities like the coronavirus? Usually timing the market is not a good idea for a layman, but AAPL didn't just become a weaker long-term investment just because China and surrounding countries currently have an outbreak, so today was a great buying opportunity for those who wish to hold onto stocks for a long time. I bought AAPL for $130/share in 2015ish and today I bought more shares at around 297-298/share. I didn't have to have a million dollars laying around to do it.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
106,"So I think where the messaging is failing is that it focuses on ‘mild’ and ‘death’ cases only. 

The larger issue for our healthcare system is that 1 out of 5 people who get sick with Covid will end up with ‘severe’ disease, meaning at home with aggressive care (i.e. visiting nurse and/or oxygen) or hospitalized. One third of hospitalized pts will end up in the ICU.

This would overrun our hospitals in terms of available beds, available ICU rooms and ventilators. Before this disease, hospitals basically run at full or 110% capacity (meaning, pts wait in the ER for the next available bed). On top of that there will be doctors and nurses on quarantine leading to understaffing (and clearly some staff will not come in to work due to fear, which we are already seeing).

This is what happened in Wuhan. Hospitals could not deal with the huge jump in severely sick pts (many of which would not die if they had adequate care). 

So anything that can slow the spread of the disease (self quarantine, cancelled events, strict hygiene) will help our hospitals remain effective for those who are sick. 

Panickers focus on fear of death; deniers focus on 80% mild cases...neither of these attitudes are helpful. More people need to understand that we need to focus on trying not to overburden our hospitals and clinics i.e. staying home if they are mildly ill (basically,self-quarantine for the greater good). Don’t go to your clinic or ER with mild symptoms. You’ll clog up the system, when self quarantine and typical self care for a cold is all you need.

Edits for grammar/typos

Edit to add: What many don’t know is that hospitals are already cancelling elective surgeries to make more ventilators available for the ICU. A lot of these people who need ventilators will not die. But if they don’t get a ventilator, they will die. So if your elective surgery gets postponed 6 months, be cool with that.",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0
107,"Don't even bother, people really love finding a chance to shit on Turkey around here. Pretty much every EU country is doing this, but the act only gains traction when Turkey is doing it.

It's kinda disgusting seeing ""Well, Turkey doesn't need those masks right now"", when that is the same mindset against Corona many EU nations had. ""

&gt; Oh it's fine, we don't need to come down hard on isolated problem areas

&gt; Naaaah, we don't need a regionwide curfew, just wash your hands

&gt; Curfew for the entire country seems a bit harsh, just try ""social distancing""

&gt; Stay home everyone, but we don't think border closing is necessary

It didn't even take 2 days from the previous ""Don't worry guys"" stances of governments for them to ramp up to the next one like there is no tomorrow. And now, many nations are prioritizing their own citizens and naturally making sure they won't be left ""unprepared"" like they have been with every single one of their decisions in the past 2-3 weeks. 

Turkey has 80M+ citizens, most are living in very densely populated cities. 16M+ alone are living Istanbul, a megacity at the size of Luxembourg. With tons of highly religious people going against the decision of the Ministry of Religious Things to go to prayers regularly with statements like ""Angels wash us during prayer"", can anyone guarantee that Turkey won't need the mask in the next 2, 5, 10 days? 

Sure, the next argument would be ""Well, if people are so stupid, maybe that's their fault"", such humanitarian there, what about all the highly careful people who are getting sick because of dickheads? The entire pandemic started because of idiots, it was transmitted to Europe because of idiots like these, it was not taken under control because of the unresponsiveness of European states scared of their economy taking a minor short term hit. Nobody bats an eye when a majority of EU states made the exact same decisions throughout this crisis. But Turkey does it? Oh boi, time to rip Turkey a new one!

You know who we should be ripping new ones? I'm from Istanbul, living in Innsbruck, Austria for University. Monday the 9th, University of Innsbruck switched to online studies urging people to stay home. I'm not an idiot, I saw what was happening right to our south in Italy, so I took the advice of the University and stayed home unless I had to go out for groceries. Subsequently, on the following thursday, our mountains shut down, saturday a curfew was decided, and the entire country decided to take action. What did people do during this time until the final curfew decision? They thought it was now ""holiday"" because ""the uni is now closed"" and started partying around, gathering next to the river and literally being as social as they can be. And look around to every country specific sub, literally everyone had these people. Italy, France, Spain, Portugal, Germany, large amounts of people completely disregarded the warnings of their governments until their own curfews hit and actively spread the disease to millions upon millions of people.

And now, every country is stuck with doing their damn best to tend to their infected because of a bunch of retards disregarding warnings. And sure as hell, every country will continue to prioritize the well being of their citizens before others in such a crisis.",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0

111,"**The number of positive coronavirus cases in Victoria has risen by 56 overnight, bringing the state's total to 411, but the Premier is concerned many people are still not taking the health crisis seriously.**

Premier Daniel Andrews said he was aware of groups of people not adhering to social-distancing guidelines.

""Victorians need to work hard to keep their distance … and not go out and live their life like this is something to ignore. This is a really, really significant issue,"" he told Triple M on Tuesday.

&gt;""This is not just about frail, elderly people, it's people in their 30s and 40s. There's international evidence that people have died much younger. That should be enough to motivate everybody to do the right thing.""

Asked why Victoria was not on a complete lockdown yet, Mr Andrews said the Government took ""a very, very big step"" on Monday.

""There will be a step two, possibly a step three,"" he said.

## What must close in Victoria:

* Pubs, clubs, hotels, bars and nightclubs that supply alcohol under a general licence (but bottleshops, takeaway meals and accommodation can continue)
* Gyms
* Indoor sporting centres
* Casinos
* ""A cinema, nightclub or entertainment venue of any kind""
* Restaurants and cafes (but takeaways and deliveries can continue)
* Places of worship (but weddings and funerals can continue)

Victorian Education Minister James Merlino told the ABC that while school holidays had been brought forward, schools had not been closed.

He said ""principals, leadership teams and some teachers"" would remain at the 1,500 public schools across Victoria to provide care for vulnerable children and children whose parents were essential workers.

""This week … many parents may not be able to provide childcare arrangements because children should have still been in school,"" he said.

Mr Merlino also said the State Government was working with childcare provider Outside School Hours Care (OSHcare) to provide care for vulnerable children and the children of essential workers from next week when school holidays were due to begin.

""We are providing an extended holiday program this week and looking at what we can provide during the term one holidays,"" he said.

Mr Merlino said essential workers would include those in the health sector, emergency services, and industries such as those manufacturing ventilators.

""It will be broad,"" he said.

Meanwhile, a case of coronavirus that sparked the evacuation of National Australia Bank's headquarters in Melbourne last week has turned out to be fake.

The building at 700 Bourke Street in Docklands was evacuated of its 6,000 occupants last week, after a NAB employee reported testing positive to COVID-19.

The 15-floor building was sanitised as a result and staff were told to work from home.

In an email to staff yesterday, the bank said the test result appeared to have been falsified and the person would not be returning to the company.

People this morning once again queued in long lines outside Centrelink to apply for government benefits.

Megan Hennessy began lining up outside the Centrelink office in Fitzroy at 6:30am after being let go from her job at a school canteen and her second job at Melbourne Aquarium.

""I tried to \[apply\] online but it's just too difficult. I was working seven days a week, so to know I have nothing now is hard. It's very hard. It's very scary,"" she said.

""We need to talk to people at Centrelink just to feel good that we know something is happening, that we will get something at some time.""

She said the number of people lining up around the block was ""crazy"".

""Everyone is in the same position. Everyone has lost their job. It's a surreal feeling. I haven't slept all night.""

Benny Rogers, 40, lined up outside Centrelink yesterday but didn't get to file an application for support because the queue was so long.

He said he was trying to be positive and had already applied for a job at Woolworths.

""I've been working for the Department of Education and I've been let go,"" he said. ""So I'm here to hopefully get on the system.""",0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0

Today's results is a further increase of [4 new positive cases] (https://news.ontario.ca/mohltc/en/2020/03/ontario-confirms-new-positive-cases-of-covid-19-4.html), bringing us to a total of 22 positive cases now. 

The first two cases of today is a husband and wife who are both in their 60s. They recently traveled aboard the Grand Princess cruise ship out of San Francisco which traveled to Mexico. They were presented at Trillium Health Partners - Mississauga Hospital and are both now in self-isolation. 

The third is a man in his 50s who recently returned from Iran and presented himself to North York General Hospital. He is now in self-isolation. The last case is a man in his 40s who came back from Las Vegas and was presented at Toronto Western Hospital. This makes him the first case we've had from the US (if you discount the couple from above since they were technically in Mexico, otherwise they're the first).

114,"&gt;... now that China actually really is/was going to surpass us I find it strange that they’re dealing with this. Now with increased sinophobia and racism towards China it just seems whack. There have been a lot of arrests lately related to china.. red baiting McCarthy era type activity in the states.. The Huawei arrest... stuff that went down in Canada.. Chinese spies trying to get in Mar-a-lago..

Oh, there is a strong anti-Beijing force within the group that put up Trump as their face. It was one of Trump's election promise in 2016, wasn't it?

Personally I think it is well warranted considering what has happened since 1985-ish till 2016 in the US. **With the Israel's lead.**

This is coming from a former card-carrying Bernie bro.

It's just extremely regrettable that the current anti-Beijing movement seems to bring along despicable racism from all sides. 

I'll see you around.

&amp;#x200B;

**As a parting thought:**

**.1.** A full blown crash between the US and China is inevitable since China's trying to dominate at the two arenas: economic supremacy (the BRI) and arms race. Can't really blame China for trying those either. It's just how global hegemony works.

**.2.** Many people, even here on this sub, misinterpreted the Huawei issue as simply a 5G thing (well ... because that's all the MSM are saying), but it's rather about military weapon technologies.

5G + next-gen optical sensors &amp; software + quantum computing = next-gen air defense systems &amp; missile systems.

What is one of the biggest reasons why US military strength is still superior? Navy. More precisely because of its supercarriers. How China is trying to bypass it? Next-gen air defense systems &amp; missile systems, a.k.a carrier killer.

Who stole the US missile systems and sold them to China? Israel. If you research on this, you'd find it complicated and at the same time upsetting (if you were a US citizen that is. \^\^').

**.3.** For the recent arrest you mentioned: Since 1980s till 2015-ish the globalist faction in the US &amp; Israel, including the US neocons, started to move or sell off the US' assets &amp; technologies to China. It's a well known + well documented affair. There are many theories on why, but I digress.

Lately, the non-globalist faction in the US has finally been trying to *overturn the tide.* For the US, it's like people say: better late than never.

**.4.** For the record, I like the theory I mentioned earlier best because it has the least of logical deficiencies:

\-- **Xi Jinping &amp; his Princelings** could be the one but they got many things to lose because of the event. Although Xi Jinping was able to set himself up to remain *president for life* (on March 2018, right?), he is still on the process of consolidating political power under Princelings, meaning if he let this event to be blown up to the next level, it will greatly endanger his authority within State Council.

Hence, has the blaming game from/within China already initiated putting a renowned SARS expert Zhong Nanshan (钟南山) up at the forefront. People I know whose day job is analyst, they're expecting that the opinion will come out from China soon which would be ""This COVID-19 has originated from a US patient last year. Not from China."" Hmm.

So, who would be the biggest beneficiary IF Xi's political downfall happens? Not the current US admin. Because China's foreign policies will stay same even IF it happens, since Shanghai clique will surely take over.

\-- **The current US admin** could be the one but this is an election year. One of their so called accomplishment for the first term that they can boast of is the Dow Jones.

I know there is a theory that concerns a financial reset, but IF the reset indeed happens this year, Trump's chances of winning at the reelection would be enormously undermined.

\-- Besides, Trump *NEEDS* China to *do well enough* during 2020 for China to keep the promise of the phase one U.S.-China trade deal: China's increased purchase of American products &amp; services by at least $200 billion over the next two years, which is almost twice the size of what China purchased before the trade war began.

And as you can guess, it's another *accomplishment* by the current US admin that Trump can boast of on the upcoming campaign trails.

But if what goes on in China continues, there is a high chance China would/could not meet the phase one deal.

116,"For those who can not make it past the paywall:

U.S. stock futures tumbled, wiping out half of the furious last-hour rally Friday and tripping exchange trading curbs, as investors worried that emergency measures by the Federal Reserve will fall short of cushioning the coronavirus’s blows to the economy.

Contracts on the S&amp;P 500, whose violent swings have now triggered limits in five of the past six sessions, dropped 4.8% to 2,555.50 as of 6:17 p.m. in New York.

The central bank cut rates by a full percentage point to near zero and said it will boost its bond holdings by $700 billion. U.S. equities are coming off their first back-to-back 9% swings since the Great Depression as investors try to price the impact of a global pandemic.


Investors remain rattled by the virus and its potential to derail global growth. Goldman Sachs cut its growth forecasts for the first half, Nike closed stores in North America and Apple shut all stores outside of China.

“They had no choice, but it won’t be enough in the grand scheme of things,” said Jeff Mills, chief investment officer of Bryn Mawr Trust. “We need large fiscal programs, which, based on the recent communication from the treasury secretary, it seems clear we will be getting.”

The extreme volatility of recent sessions makes it difficult to consider futures a perfect litmus for grading the Fed’s response. Contracts bounced between exchange-enforced volatility limits throughout last week, while Friday saw the biggest U.S. stock market rally in 12 years. That surge may have been attributable in part to expectations the Fed would act over the weekend.

Similar turbulence has gripped markets around the world amid an outbreak that threatens to plunge the global economy into recession. Gauges of stock swings hit levels last seen in the financial crisis and the S&amp;P 500 notched back-to-back 9% moves for the first time since the 1930s on Thursday and Friday.

“What a roller-coaster ride this is turning out to be,” Erik Nielsen, group chief economist at UniCredit, wrote in a note. “I never thought I would see such volatility, intra-day moves and general dislocations again in highly developed markets.”

S&amp;P 500 rose or fell at least 4% five days in a row, a stretch not seen since 1929
The index jumped more than 5 percentage points in the final 30 minutes Friday to cap a 9% rally that was the biggest in over a decade, spurred by Trump declaring a national emergency and outlining measures to support the economy.


The virus has spread to more than 3,000 Americans and grinding activity in Europe to a virtual standstill.

“‘There will be an economic impact,” said Megan Horneman, director of portfolio strategy at Verdence Capital Advisors. “We won’t know what that is until we see the data.”

An uneven response from politicians has rattled investors trying to figure out how to value companies whose earnings forecasts have become useless. Nike Inc. closed all its stores in North America and Western Europe Sunday, while Apple Inc. shuttered its outlets everywhere but China until March 27.

U.S. economic growth is forecast to nearly halt in the second quarter and recession odds have jumped, Bloomberg’s March 6-12 survey of economists shows.

“The inherent uncertainties stemming from the spreading of the virus were multiplied many times over by some dreadful policy communication, but also tempered by a series of outstanding policy measures, including actions by central banks and fiscal authorities,” UniCredit’s Nielsen said.

The S&amp;P 500 average a move of 7.2% last week in the most volatile period since 2008. Stocks dropped 9.5% Thursday and rose 9.3% Friday, in the first such reversal since the Great Depression.

“We tend, in the midst of bear markets, in these crises, to see big, big swings like this, both on the downside and the upside,” said Jennifer Ellison, principal at San Francisco-based wealth-advisory firm BOS. “We get this self-fulfilling prophecy. When markets are down and they start to spiral, everybody wants to run for the exits. And then they think they missed out on the bottom and they run back in.”",1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0

If  you want to win the battle, you must  fully know &amp; understand the  enemies, their mechanism &amp; features,  weakness &amp; strength.

The  Chinese Government has underestimated  the nCOV new Corona Virus, that  is why they are failing and on the verse  of a complete total collapse.

As  a master of this Earth game, I can tell  you that the real dangerous of  the nCOV is not just above what the  media &amp; scientist are telling  &amp; will discovering in near future,  but even far more than what any  Governments &amp; secret societies even  dream &amp; thinking.

In your thinking, what is a perfect deadly virus, what features it should have?

Then  that is exactly the nCOV feature  humanity are facing. It is even  beyond novel &amp; video game virus  version one. It is the absolutely  perfect one virus.

**I will tell you some basic features of the nCOV:**

– It can hide and stay in many popular daily objects like technology devices, doors, motors, cars, cloths, etc.

– It can stay in almost all conditions like humans including cold and hot.

– It can easily spread through air.

– It has all the features of a combination SARS, Ebola, HIV and even more than that.

– It can detect bad &amp; good people &amp; has it own spirit like a seen animal.

– It can develop and has it own evolution daily non-stop to adapt new environment.

– No any vaccine drug can work for this type of virus.

Etc.

**You may ask so are we all going to receive that deadly virus?**

My answer is that yes, all of you are going to receive that type in your life.

Many  “weaker” Virus exist in your daily  life environment already, it just  that they are not “strong” enough for  human need to be aware. But now  it is just a more “stronger” one.

**How to counter &amp; overcome that nCOV virus?**

I  am not telling you now because I want to  change the world system  completely and give people more choice. And my  blog website not yet  famous. I do not want any secret societies, beings,  government stealing  &amp; take credit for my own invention &amp;  creation.

Maybe  many of the world leaders are in  same bed, same secret societies and  work against &amp; want enslave the  rest. Many of them are going to die  because of this nCOV virus for sure  !!!

Why  there are no bounty reward from your  government or any international  organization for whoever able to solve  this epidemic problems? Why  don’t use the brain &amp; mind set of all  humanity together, but only  rely on some “doctor, scientist”.

You  need to remember that the SARS was  cured not because of any vaccine or  drug from the doctor/lab house. It  came from pure luck of  understanding the feature/mechanism of the SARS.

So you better stop waiting the doctors, scientist, etc.

The  only way out of this deadly global  epidemic event is listen to me and  receive full mechanism, features of  this new Corona virus, and of  course include a working cure as well.

So  if you want a perfect working cure for  this deadly nCOV virus, you  guys better telling your government/groups  and share it to your friends  about my web page [https://theworld.data.blog](https://theworld.data.blog/) &amp; [https://freejoy.aimoo.com](https://freejoy.aimoo.com/) .

118,"&gt; # 3 teenagers arrested over spitting incident in Bugis mall

&gt; Another three teenagers have been arrested in connection with a spitting incident.

&gt; The three teenagers, aged between 16 and 18, were arrested on Tuesday for allegedly spitting over the railing in a Bugis shopping mall.

&gt; The police said in a statement yesterday they received a report that a male victim was on the ground floor of the shopping mall in Victoria Street when spittle from a higher floor landed on him.

&gt; Investigations showed that three boys spat over the railing from the fifth floor of the mall last Thursday, some time after 5pm. With the help of police cameras, officers from the Central Police Division established the identities of the suspects.

&gt; The teenagers are being investigated for being a public nuisance.

&gt; The police said the incident caused alarm and annoyance in the light of the coronavirus outbreak, since infections can spread indirectly through contaminated surfaces.

&gt; The arrests come in the wake of a number of other similar incidents also involving teenagers.

&gt; Last Thursday, two boys and one girl, aged between 17 and 19, were arrested over a suspected spitting incident in a shopping mall in central Singapore.

&gt; Last month, two teenage boys aged 12 and 17 were apprehended for allegedly spitting inside public lifts in Housing Board blocks.

&gt; This was after two separate reports, on Feb 23 and 25, of spittle being found on the mirrors and buttons inside the lifts of HDB blocks in Punggol Walk and Ang Mo Kio Street 32.

&gt; In another case, police quizzed three 15-year-olds after SBS Transit lodged a police report on Feb 20 when spittle was found on the buttons of a lift at Rumbia LRT station.

&gt; The teenagers are being investigated for an offence of mischief. Investigations showed that the offence was committed on Feb 19 at about 6.10pm. Anyone found guilty of being a public nuisance can be fined up to $2,000.

&gt; If the public nuisance act is found to have caused or will probably cause common injury, danger or annoyance to the public, those found guilty can be jailed for up to three months, fined up to $2,000, or both.

&gt; If convicted of mischief, they can be jailed for up to two years, or fined, or both.

&gt; Those under the age of 16 cannot be jailed.

&gt; ""Everyone needs to play their part by observing good personal hygiene and being socially responsible,"" the police said yesterday.

121,"In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDon’tComeToJapan has been trending on Twitter. In Singapore, tens of thousands of residents have signed a petition calling for the government to ban Chinese nationals from entering the country.

In Hong Kong, South Korea and Vietnam, businesses have posted signs saying that mainland Chinese customers are not welcome. In France, a front-page headline in a regional newspaper warned of a “Yellow Alert.” And in a suburb of Toronto, parents demanded that a school district keep children of a family that had recently returned from China out of classes for 17 days.

The rapid spread of the coronavirus that has sickened about 9,800 people — the overwhelming majority in China, with all of the 213 deaths there — has unleashed a wave of panic and, in some cases, outright anti-Chinese sentiment across the globe.

While officials scramble to contain the crisis — the World Health Organization declared a global health emergency and the State Department issued a “do not travel” to China advisory — fears over the dangerous outbreak have fueled xenophobia. And the wave of spreading panic has, at times, far outstripped practical concerns.

At a time when China’s rise as a global economic and military power has unsettled its neighbors in Asia as well as its rivals in the West, the coronavirus is feeding into latent bigotry against the people of mainland China.

“Some of the xenophobia is likely undergirded by broader political and economic tensions and anxieties related to China, which are interacting with more recent fears of contagion,” said Kristi Govella, an assistant professor of Asian studies at the University of Hawaii, Manoa.

Some of the response to the outbreak can be seen as a rational calculation based on the risk of infection: Airlines are canceling flights to Wuhan, the center of the epidemic, and other Chinese cities, and conference organizers are asking Chinese delegations not to attend. 

Late Thursday, Italy’s prime minister said that his country had blocked all flights to and from China. And countries like Malaysia, the Philippines, Russia and Vietnam have temporarily stopped issuing certain classes of visas to travelers from Hubei Province, where Wuhan is situated, or China altogether.

“I think it is time to put a temporary ‘do not enter’ sign on our doorstep for visitors from China,” said Ralph Recto, a lawmaker in the Philippines.

Bangkok residents are avoiding malls that are particularly popular with Chinese tourists. A plastic surgery office in the wealthy Gangnam neighborhood of Seoul has instructed employees that they can see Chinese customers only if they can prove that they have been in South Korea for 14 days or more, the potential period that the virus can lie dormant.

At a sushi restaurant in the neighborhood that once housed the Tsukiji fish market in Tokyo, where about 90 percent of the customers are Chinese, Yaeko Suenaga, 70, a server, said she understood why some stores might want to reject visitors from China.

“I don’t think this fear comes from discrimination,” Ms. Suenaga said, “but from the true fear that humans have of getting infected with a virus that may lead to death.” Ms. Suenaga said that her restaurant would continue to welcome all customers, but that workers would wear masks.

It is not always easy to discern the boundary between understandable fear and unmistakable discrimination. But some protective measures have effectively amounted to racial or ethnic profiling.

At Bread Box, a banh mi restaurant in central Hoi An, a popular tourist outpost in Vietnam, the owners posted a makeshift sign outside their storefront this month reading, “We can’t service for Chinese, SORRY!” Up the coast, the Danang Riverside Hotel announced on Saturday that it would not accept any Chinese guests because of the virus.

Kwong Wing Catering, a small restaurant chain in Hong Kong, announced in a Facebook post on Wednesday that it would serve only patrons speaking English or Cantonese, the city’s native language — a tongue distinct from the Mandarin spoken on the mainland. The business has been a vocal supporter of the Hong Kong democracy movement that has risen up in defiance of Beijing.

Public health experts said they understood some of the impulses. “In a sense, it’s a natural reaction to try to distance yourself from a potential cause of illness, particularly when there’s no known cure,” said Karen Eggleston, director of the Asia health policy program at the Shorenstein Asia-Pacific Research Center at Stanford University.

But examples in both mass and social media have clearly crossed a line. In Australia, The Herald Sun, a Murdoch-owned newspaper, published the words “China Virus Panda-monium” over an image of a red mask. More than 46,000 people from the resident Chinese community in Australia signed a petition that called the headline “unacceptable race discrimination.”

Le Courrier Picard, a regional newspaper in northern France, caused outrage with its “Yellow Alert” headline this month. The newspaper later apologized.

On Twitter in Japan, where there has long been unease about the conduct of Chinese tourists, commenters have labeled them “dirty” and “insensitive” and have called them “bioterrorists.”",1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0

""Countless Countries Are Evacuating Nationals from China

Whereas annual flu toxicity is adjudicated by modeling case numbers, and by sophisticated and learned guesses at the number of likely infections, so far the death rate of the coronavirus is calibrated a bit differently — apparently predicated both on known deaths and known cases. When we make facile comparisons between the flu and coronaviruses, they may prove valid, but for now it’s still wise to remember that annual flu cases could be fewer than what is guessed at through modeling each year, and corona infections may be higher than the current known numbers of confirmed positives. The former reality might mean that the flu is at times a little more lethal than we think and the corona virus a little less deadly. That is not to suggest that most strains of flu are as lethal as the coronavirus, only that for the vast majority of Americans the current U.S. COVID-19 case-to-fatality ratio of 2 percent may eventually prove less, and influenza’s commonly cited 0.01 lethality rate may prove higher. In any case, 98–99 percent of Americans may well recover from the coronavirus — a rate that is not typical of most of history’s plagues.

&amp;#x200B;

The realities are paradoxical: If the coronavirus infects as many Americans as an average flu strain, then ten times more Americans could die — mostly over the age of 65 — even as the vast majority of all Americans will not. Statistics change hourly, but the CDC as of the afternoon of March 16 reports that there are currently 3,437 cases of known coronavirus infections and 68 deaths attributed to the virus, or about two deaths per 100 infected — the majority of them again likely over 65.

&amp;#x200B;

To the degree that we are suffering death and economic hurt from COVID-19, we can also attribute the toll to the Chinese Communist Party. Had it just called in the international medical community in late November, instituted early quarantines, and allowed its own citizens to use email and social media to apprise and warn others of the new disease, then the world and the U.S. would probably not have found themselves in the current panic. The reasons China did not act more responsibly may be inherent in communist governments, or they may involve more Byzantine causes left to be disclosed.

&amp;#x200B;

Add in the proximity of a Level 4 virology lab nearby Ground Zero of COVID-19, which fueled Internet conspiracy theories; the weird rumors about quite strange animals such as snakes and pangolins birthing the infection in primeval open meat markets stocked with live animals in filthy conditions in cages; and pirated videos of supposed patients dropping comatose in crowded hospital hallways. With all of that, we had the ingredients of a Hollywood zombie movie, adding to the frenzy.

&amp;#x200B;

Plus, 2020 is an election year — echoing how the 1976 swine flu was politicized. The Left and its media appendages saw COVID-19 as able to do what John Brennan, James Clapper, James Comey, and Andrew McCabe, the Mueller team, and impeachment could not: destroy the hated Trump presidency.

&amp;#x200B;

China will rue what it begat.

That is, it will come to appreciate fully that the supposed efficiency, ruthlessness, and autocracy of the Communist Party — what had so impressed foolish American journalists who once marveled at Beijing’s ability to enact by fiat liberal pet projects such as high-speed rail and solar industries — were China’s worst enemies, ensuring that the virus would spread and that China’s international reputation would be ruined.

&amp;#x200B;

The coronavirus could be the straw that breaks the proverbial back of the Chinese camel, stooped under the recent weight of a trade war with the U.S., the revelation of 1 million Uighurs in reeducation camps, the crackdown on Hong Kong democracy protesters, and news of the sprawling Chinese internal-surveillance apparat. The world is now both terrified and put off by China, and such anathemas will only harm its already suspect and misbegotten Silk Road neocolonial schemes.

&amp;#x200B;

Here in the U.S., COVID-19 will create bipartisan pressure to adopt policies of keeping key U.S. industries — such as medical supplies, pharmaceuticals, and military applied high-tech — in America. Americans will not again wish to outsource the vast majority of their chemotherapy-drug, antibiotic, and heart-medicine production to a government that cannot be trusted and that sees such globalized output as a weapon to be used in extremis.

&amp;#x200B;

Although we cannot see it now, spin-off effects from the panic and frenzy will eventually fuel more economic recovery. Oil prices are nearing record modern lows, ensuring cheap gas for spring and summer American drivers. Cheap mortgages and car loans likewise will spur buying, as will relief once the virus wanes and splurging ensue.

&amp;#x200B;

It will be salutary for Americans to once again appreciate the value of muscular labor, as those who grow food, transport it, and provide us energy and sanitation while protecting us from danger, foreign and domestic, have allowed millions of Americans to stay home, sequestered and quarantined but safe with plenty of food, water, and uninterrupted sanitation and public safety. In these days of crisis, we should not forget that millions of often unmentioned Americans have made us the world’s greatest energy and most diverse food producer — a singular position that China, with over four times our population, envies.

Before the outbreak, China was trying to game its trade war in terms of how best to hurt the hated Trump administration. Ironically, its abhorrence only strengthened the U.S. in ways no one in the pre-COVID-19 days could have imagined.

&amp;#x200B;

Call it paradox, irony, karma, or even tragedy, but China emerges from its deceit about the coronavirus outbreak in its weakest position since its Westernization began under Deng Xiaoping. And the U.S., after some rocky months ahead, if it stays calm, will likely reemerge in its strongest state in memory vis-à-vis its rivals.""",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0
124,"This definitely has some merit.

If true this would mean the total death count is about 15,000. When compared to the official number of infected China has claimed + rest of the world, about 31,000,, that'd make the fatality rate something like 30%-50%. Of course that seems far too high, which tells us China is definitely lying about the number of infected. I'd be willing to bet the actual fatality rate is about 10%. Same as SARS.

Because that's what this thing is: SARS. Something I haven't seen mentioned at all.

In reality the 2019 Wuhan Coronavirus is a sibling of SARS (which is itself a coronavirus). They're extremely close. Not just extremely: they're basically fucking identical. The only real difference is in a couple proteins which changes how it binds to cells (which changes the way it spreads between humans). But the way they enter the cell, and everything after that (replicating in the cell, etc), is 100% identical.

SARS itself is incredibly lethal and dangerous, with a fatality rate of 10%, which rises to 50% in the elderly. 

However, like most fatal infections, SARS has limited spread, and thus never became a big issue. Diseases like that usually kill hundreds and then burn themselves out. They aren't able to start massive pandemics like a flu is able to.

However, this seems different. This seems like it's spreading incredibly fast.

That, combined with the overwhelming evidence that this is man made, makes everything fall into place.

Basically what happened was a high level biowarfare lab had the idea of taking extremely fatal, yet not readily spreadable/infectious diseases, and altering them in order to make them able to spread fast, like a flu.

That's why this Wuhan coronavirus has some weird HIV inserts and some other seemingly random changes. Yet fundamentally it's identical to SARS and they're mostly the same virus.

This could be very bad. If it even has a 5% mortality rate then we're fucked. It will kill a lot of people. This could potentially be super-SARS, SARS with the same lethality but 10x the rate of infection.

Like I said, the only real difference between SARS and this coronavirus is how they initially bind to the cell. The 2019 coronavirus has a new protein which seems to allow it to bind to alveolar cells, meaning the lungs. This means the lungs have now become a prime entrance for this virus + coughing can spread it effectively now too.

Like I said, nearly the same virus except for a few key (and intelligently designed) differences.",0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0

Quote from the report, ""Ms. Yang, who attended the inauguration, started a company — GY US Investments — that promised Chinese businesspeople access to American politicians, including Mr. Trump. Clients were offered entry to events, including White House visits, “VIP activities at Mar-a-Lago” and Warren Buffett’s annual meeting of Berkshire Hathaway shareholders.

Sun Ye, an actress in Beijing, was among those who appeared in photographs on Ms. Yang’s website. Ms. Sun said she wanted to travel to the United States to burnish her image in China and abroad. She said she took a deluxe tour last year that included visits to Harvard, the Nasdaq marketplace and the White House. For part of the trip, she said, she stayed with Ms. Yang.

The highlight, she said, was to be in a photo with the president at a New Year’s party at Mar-a-Lago, one of the events promoted on Ms. Yang’s website.

Mr. Trump, however, skipped the party and stayed in Washington because of a government shutdown. Ms. Sun settled for a photo with his son Donald Jr.

“I wanted to see the president of the United States, and although I didn’t meet him, I met his family,” Ms. Sun said in an interview in Beijing. “It made me feel like I achieved my dream.”""",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
126,"Center for Disease Control's 2017 seasonal flu world wide death estimates:

https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2017/p1213-flu-death-estimate.html

Excerpt:

According to new estimates published today, between 291,000 and 646,000 people worldwide die from seasonal influenza-related respiratory illnesses each year, higher than a previous estimate of 250,000 to 500,000 and based on a robust, multinational survey.

The new estimate, from a collaborative study by CDC and global health partners, appears today in The Lancet. The estimate excludes deaths during pandemics.

“These findings remind us of the seriousness of flu and that flu prevention should really be a global priority,” says Joe Bresee, M.D., associate director for global health in CDC’s Influenza Division and a study co-author.

The new estimates use more recent data, taken from a larger and more diverse group of countries than previous estimates. Forty-seven countries contributed to this effort. Researchers calculated annual seasonal influenza-associated respiratory deaths for 33 of those countries (57 percent of the world’s population) that had death records and seasonal influenza surveillance information for a minimum of four years between 1999 and 2015. Statistical modeling with those results was used to generate an estimate of the number of flu-associated respiratory deaths for 185 countries across the world. Data from the other 14 countries were used to validate the estimates of seasonal influenza-associated respiratory death from the statistical models.

Poorest nations, older adults hit hardest by flu

Researchers calculated region-specific estimates and age-specific mortality estimates for people younger than 65 years, people 65-74 years, and people 75 years and older. The greatest flu mortality burden was seen in the world’s poorest regions and among older adults. People age 75 years and older and people living in sub-Saharan African countries experienced the highest rates of flu-associated respiratory deaths. Eastern Mediterranean and Southeast Asian countries had slightly lower but still high rates of flu-associated respiratory deaths.

&gt; SINGAPORE: There are no plans to cancel Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) in-camp training amid concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, Senior Minister of State for Defence Heng Chee How said on Tuesday (Feb 11).

&gt; 

&gt; “We have to go back to the mission of the SAF and the defence of this country. We have to defend this country whether or not there is a virus situation,” he said.

&gt;

&gt; “That said, we must understand that when there is such a situation, we must take the necessary steps to safeguard the health of our soldiers.

&gt; 

&gt; “This is exactly what we are doing – to make sure that both are top priorities.”

&gt;

&gt; The individual physical proficiency test (IPPT) will also not be cancelled at unit level.

&gt; “If they are sick, then they should let it be known so that we can then ask them not to undertake IPPT, (or) it can be rescheduled so that in the meantime you can seek treatment,” Mr Heng continued.

&gt; 

&gt; Mr Heng was speaking to reporters at the Basic Military Training Centre (BMTC) on Pulau Tekong after observing stepped up measures against the virus outbreak.

&gt; 

&gt; The centre, which currently has 5,000 recruits, has introduced measures like social distancing as well as increased frequency of cleaning and temperature-taking.

&gt; 

&gt; This comes after some members of the public have written to the media urging ICTs to be suspended following local transmissions of the coronavirus.

&gt; Senior Minister of State for Defence Heng Chee How. (Photo: Try Sutrisno Foo)

&gt; ​​​​​​​

&gt; “The very purpose of my visit today is indeed to give confidence to our soldiers and their families that there is no need to worry, that we understand the situation and that we have in place the measures, (which are) the same as those maintained on the mainland under the guidance of the MOH (Ministry of Health),” Mr Heng said.

&gt; 

&gt; While Mr Heng stressed that BMTC does not have a confirmed case of the virus, he said suspected cases will be sent to the island’s medical centre, which has “exactly the same” standards and procedures as those adopted by MOH on the mainland.

&gt; 

&gt; “If the doctor over here feels the patient fits the criteria that needs to be referred to the NCID (National Centre for Infectious Diseases), then that will be done,” he said.

&gt; 

&gt; “Following that, we will do the necessary contact tracing as well as segregation of the close contacts for close monitoring.”

&gt; 

&gt; SOCIAL DISTANCING

&gt; 

&gt; The BMTC has also introduced staggered meal times and book-in and book-out timings to minimise interaction among servicemen.

&gt; 

&gt; Each meal period has been divided into four timings to accommodate two companies of soldiers each. One company has 220 servicemen.

&gt; 

&gt; Previously, more than four companies could eat during the same meal period.

&gt; Soldiers eating at Basic Military Training Centre (BMTC) on Pulau Tekong on Feb 11. (Photo: Try Sutrisno Foo)

&gt; BMTC has also cancelled or rescheduled physical activities where prolonged interaction is expected, like aqua jogging in the pool.

&gt; 

&gt; In addition, it has deferred non-essential social activities like the recruits’ evening and external talks.

&gt; 

&gt; Servicemen have been provided with stronger disinfectants like bleach and instructed to clean their bunks more frequently. SAF-chartered ferries and buses are also being cleaned more frequently.

&gt; 

&gt; Similar measures have been implemented at all SAF camps.

&gt; 

&gt; The centre is also considering reducing the number of public visitors at the next graduation parade in March and direct enlistment on Pulau Tekong in April.

&gt; 

&gt; Recruits at Basic Military Training Centre (BMTC) on Pulau Tekong on Feb 11. (Photo: Try Sutrisno Foo)

&gt; During the H1N1 flu outbreak in 2009, BMTC reduced the number of visitors each servicemen could invite to their graduation parade from four to two.

&gt; 

&gt; DORSCON ORANGE

&gt; 

&gt; The measures come after Singapore on Friday raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange. The country has 45 confirmed cases of the coronavirus as of Monday.

&gt; 

&gt; Under the new DORSCON level, organisers of large events should take necessary precautions such as carrying out temperature screening, looking out for respiratory symptoms like cough or runny nose, and denying entry to unwell individuals.

&gt; 

&gt; BMTC has increased the frequency of temperature-taking for active personnel from once to at least twice a day.

&gt; 

&gt; A soldier washing his hands after eating in the canteen at Basic Military Training Centre (BMTC) on Pulau Tekong on Feb 11. (Photo: Try Sutrisno Foo)

&gt; It has also introduced an online health declaration form for visitors and contractors, with restrictions for those with recent travel to China.

&gt; 

&gt; If the DORSCON level is raised to the maximum Red, the centre will align its measures with those introduced by the Ministry of Health.

&gt; 

&gt; Mr Heng said: “We have also reminded every soldier to take good care of himself and herself to go see a doctor or let the commanders know when you’re feeling unwell.”

&gt; 

&gt; CLEANING BUNKS

&gt; 

&gt; While Recruit Zachary Ho said it’s definitely “quite a hassle” to have to clean his bunk more frequently, he acknowledged the rationale behind it given the virus outbreak.

&gt; 

&gt; “As much as we hate it, we’ll do our best to try to reach every nook and cranny of the bunk to make sure it’s free of dust and bacteria,” the 18-year-old said.

&gt; 

&gt; “We use the anti-bacterial wet wipes or bleach given to us to clean down the room as best as we can.”

&gt; 

&gt; Recruits at Basic Military Training Centre (BMTC) on Pulau Tekong on Feb 11. (Photo: Try Sutrisno Foo)

&gt; Recruit Muhammad Syukri Sallehuddin, 18, said his parents were initially concerned for his well-being after the DORSCON level was raised and asked if the flu had been going around.

&gt; 

&gt; “After knowing the measures, they were less worried,” he added. “The commanders really try to open up and ask us to let them know if we were feeling unwell.”

&gt; 

&gt; The platoon commanders in charge of the recruits said they make it a point to enforce the increased frequency of cleaning to ensure the bunks are hygienic.

&gt; 

&gt; Beyond that, Second Lieutenant John Pravin Kanesan, 22, said it was about being more open with recruits and telling them it’s fine to inform of symptoms and report sick.

&gt; 

&gt; “After DORSCON Orange, what we have started thinking about more is to ensure that there’s an open culture of reporting whenever recruits are feeling sick,” he added.

Wuhan to close its largest makeshift hospital
of the Wuhan Living Room Exhibition Center, on March 6, 2020. The hospital will be closed on March 8. Wuhan in Central China's Hubei province is about to close its largest makeshift hospital after the last group of patients moved to other hospital on Saturday afternoon.

The hospital, built in three days to offer more beds for novel coronavirus patients, has admitted 1,760 patients with no fatality or medical staff infected by the virus, said Zhang Junjian, head of the hospital, who is also the vice-president of Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University.

Today, another state in the United States has declared a state of emergency, and the state of Florida in the United States has declared a state of public health emergency. The governor's office of Florida has announced that the state has found two confirmed cases of new coronary pneumonia and need to wait for further confirmation from the US Centers for Disease Control. The two are being treated in isolation. This is the third state in the United States to declare a state of emergency after California and Washington states. It can be seen that the new crown pneumonia epidemic has shown signs of sparking fire in the United States, and after the first case of new crown pneumonia deaths was announced in the United States yesterday, today There has been one death from neocoronary pneumonia, and a total of two deaths have occurred. However, it is ridiculous that the United States now needs to confirm a new case of new pneumonia in the United States and it needs final review by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This is why Florida is very dissatisfied with this. It was declared a state of emergency.

Obviously, the true outbreak of new coronary pneumonia in the United States has been seriously underestimated. The reason is that all confirmed cases must be finally identified by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which has made the United States' data always suspicion worldwide.

As the U.S. crown pneumonia epidemic is getting more and more serious, Trump has also kept coming out to let the Americans not panic, but the actual situation is that Trump is also very anxious. The U.S. vice president responsible for the prevention and control of the new crown pneumonia epidemic is even more Was so nervous, praying for the new crown pneumonia epidemic to pass as soon as possible in the White House office.

At this time, Trump made a big change and began to praise China. At a press conference the day before yesterday, an American reporter asked Trump: ""If the new crown pneumonia outbreak in the United States worsens, will the US government consider taking similar measures to China?""

Trump immediately said that he would take some Chinese measures to control the new crown pneumonia, and said that China has made great progress now. We can see that Starbucks has reopened in China, and Apple has fully resumed production in China. China ’s New crown pneumonia prevention and control has indeed made great progress.

Obviously, Trump's remarks came from the bottom of his heart, and it is also because the role has now changed. China has made significant progress in controlling the new crown pneumonia, but the United States is in a torrential storm. More and more states An emergency was declared, medical supplies in the United States were extremely scarce, and an out-of-control epidemic of new pneumonia was almost inevitable.

The U.S. stock market has plummeted continuously, with a drop of more than 12% in just one week. It has caught up with the big crash during the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis. This makes Trump feel like a pinch. Once the U.S. stock market continues to plummet, it will not only affect the U.S. economy, but also affect the economy. Lampe ’s president is re-elected, and once the new crown pneumonia epidemic continues, Trump ’s throne will face increasing challenges.

If at this time China announced that it would restrict the entry of Americans or people who have been to the United States, and that it would ban the travel of Chinese to the United States, it would actually impose a travel ban on the United States. It plummeted, but China did not.

And everyone should know that when the new crown pneumonia epidemic broke out in Wuhan, Hubei, China, Trump ’s US government first announced the return of Americans from Wuhan, China, causing other countries to follow up, making China very passive at the time.

Not only that, the U.S. government also announced that restricting the entry of Chinese and foreigners who have visited China into the U.S. is actually an indirect declaration of a travel ban on China, which isolates other countries in the world from China, and has a great economic impact on China. of.

These practices in the United States are very unkind. They can be described as falling into the ground and killing people while they are ill. Now China's new crown pneumonia epidemic has been controlled. Except for Wuhan, new confirmed cases have been added in single digits. But it's getting worse.

If China retaliates against the United States at this time, in addition to announcing a travel ban on the United States, it will also announce strategic control over medical products and ban exports to the United States. Then the United States will be caught in the ocean of new crown viruses.

According to the US CDC officials, most masks in the United States are made in China and imported from China. If China bans the export of masks to the United States, the United States will fall into the mask shortage, and the most basic measures to prevent new crown virus Can't do it.

Also according to the US CDC officials, most of the drugs in the United States are imported, and some drugs are imported from Europe. However, Europe also places the production base of these drugs in China, so more than 90% of the US imported drugs are Related to China. The implication is that at this time, as long as China announces that its drugs are as domestic as possible and banned exports, the United States will fall into the hell of the new crown pneumonia epidemic.

However, there is a great love in the world. The Chinese people and the Chinese government have never done so. They have not insulted the United States, nor have they banned the export of masks and medicines to the United States. As China ’s new crown pneumonia epidemic is gradually controlled, China ’s ability to export masks and medicines Will be greatly enhanced, and the United States is one of the demand side. US government officials, such as Secretary of Commerce Rose, US Secretary of State Pompeo, and US White House Economic Adviser Navarro, have publicly gloated over China's new crown pneumonia epidemic, saying that the outbreak of the new crown pneumonia epidemic in China is good for the United States and will help companies return to the United States. It also called on companies around the world to consider the risks of China's supply chain. Even the infamous ""Wall Street Journal"" published an infamous article ""China is a real patient in Asia"", and the ""New York Times"" in the United States also published a document condemning the closure of Wuhan in China as a violation of human rights. The American culture of falling rocks is really shameless. Today, Feng Shui is taking turns, and the United States has become a victim of the new crown pneumonia epidemic. At this time, China has not fallen into rocks and has not condemned the United States. At this time, the United States should be more mistakes for the past. Apologize to China for your actions.

During this time, a voice deliberately speculated that China owes the world an apology, which is very ridiculous. In order to fight the new crown pneumonia epidemic, China has made huge sacrifices, paid huge economic costs, and cut off the new crown virus. The route of transmission. No country has made such a great sacrifice and effort in this new crown pneumonia epidemic.

Moreover, according to the research of Academician Zhong Nanshan, although the new crown pneumonia epidemic broke out in China, the source may not necessarily be in China. Many studies have also pointed out that the origin of the new crown virus may come from other countries. Many confirmed cases of new crown pneumonia in the United States, Italy, Iran and other countries without a history of Asian contact have demonstrated this, so China has no reason to apologize.

Now we should rightfully say that the United States owes China an apology, and the world owes China a gratitude. Without China ’s huge sacrifice and dedication, it would not be possible to win a precious time window for the world to fight against the new crown pneumonia epidemic. The hard-to-find new crown pneumonia epidemic has been blocked for a long time, it is really shocking, crying ghosts!

137,"Exactly! One aspect I haven’t heard anyone address is 
that many, if not the majority of viruses, lay dormant even after the body fights them off then can resurface later and become contagious. 

i.e. mono/epstein bar, chickenpox/shingles, EBV, HSV

These Novel Corona virus survivors may not have symptoms anymore, or be contagious for months/years, then when their immune system gets run down they become contagious again. 

There was as a new case confirmed in AZ and I heard there are cases in San Francisco confirmed that will be coming out in the news soon. 

It’s also infuriating they keep down playing that only older people are dying of it, so not a concern for the majority even if it does spread.  We know that many viruses cause chronic disease i.e. cancer or hoshimotos, even if you get over the initial sickness from the virus.  Who knows how debilitated the survivors will be longterm from this mutating bat virus.  

China confirmed a “possible” mutation 5 days ago. If China is going to even bring this up, then the answer is - yes, 100% it mutated. - Even though the CDC announced today it has not mutated in the US. - From our few confirmed cases... that means nothing. 

Those with confirmed cases, and their close contacts, should be quarantined indefinitely until they figure out more information on this virus and what the implications of these mutations are, or come up with a vaccine.   All countries with the means should be building separate hospitals like China is - as we obviously already know how this is going to play out.",1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

A CDC-developed laboratory test kit to detect 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) began shipping yesterday to select qualified U.S. and international laboratories.

That is, they started shipping their proprietary test kit on Feb. 5.

The test kit has not been FDA cleared or approved, however distribution and use of the test kits follows the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) February 4, 2020, issuance of an Emergency Use Authorizationexternal icon (EUA).

And to jump past the initial resistance to giving the contract to an unapproved supplier, they put a faux-limit on it:

This test is only authorized for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of emergency use of in vitro diagnostic tests for detection and/or diagnosis of 2019-nCoV under Section 564(b)(1) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360bbb-3(b)(1)

There's a global pandemic on the horizon. What does a predatory Republican capitalist do?

1.	⁠⁠develop a new proprietary test and scale manufacturing fast
2.	⁠⁠reject existing approved tests
3.	⁠⁠when it's ready to ship, declare an emergency to allow the new test to skip FDA approval
4.	⁠⁠cover-up of the failings of the quick-to-market test
5.	⁠⁠Pence/CDC grants the contracts for ""115 qualified U.S. laboratories, such as state and local public health laboratories and Department of Defense (DoD) laboratories, as well as 191 qualified international laboratories"" effectively giving all the market share to their test and their supplier(s)

History will reveal this entire episode as another classic example of how the Trump GOP uses the government to exploit a pandemic for profit. Follow the money and the cronies and the names of the opportunists in this corner-the-market scheme will eventually come out.’

139,"Already more than 24,000 deaths from coronavirus?  The Communist Party of China has been accused of underreporting coronavirus cases and deaths, and late Saturday evening (Feb. 1), the Chinese news service Tencent may have accidentally leaked real data on Wuhan virus deaths, according to Taiwan News.

According to the Taiwan News,  Tencent showed confirmed cases of coronavirus in China at 154,023 on its webpage “Epidemic Situation Tracker.” That number is 10 times the official figure at the time. Tencent listed the number of suspected cases as 79,808, four times the official figure.

Most ominously, the death toll listed was 24,589, vastly higher than the 300 officially listed that day.

The number of cured cases was only 269.

Even MORE significant..

QUOTE – Another strange phenomenon that netizens have noticed is the mortality rate, as the government death tolls are routinely maintaining an exact percentile for days on end. Many noticed that in the early days of reporting, the government put the death rate at 3.1 percent.

Jan. 22: 17 deaths / 542 infections = 3.1 percent

Jan. 23: 26 deaths / 830 infections = 3.1 percent

Jan. 24: 41 deaths / 1,287 infections = 3.1 percent

By late January, the government apparently decided to set the new official mortality rate at 2.1 percent. As can be seen in the image below, the mortality rate was kept at a precise 2.1 percent, regardless of the numbers from Jan. 30 to Feb. 3:

1. Regarding the civil service, this is one guy who was on a short hit-list of obstructive civil servants who has jumped before he was pushed and who has decided to go down with his fists flying in the hope he can damage Priti Patels future prospects. I don't see any evidence of a rank-and-file revolt in the civil service. It's never been a big secret that the civil service are London based, affluent, university educated and therefore they fit the remainer demographic. I think this is the governments way of signalling that the function of the civil service is to effect government policy... so if civil servants aren't prepared to do that then there is no future for them in the civil service. This government has staked out its future on effecting Brexit and by necessity that means the civil service needs to get behind it. There just isn't room for obstructive remainerism in the civil service anymore. Lets face it - Philip Rutnam brought a knife to a gunfight when he/his allies briefed the media against Priti Patel, and he paid the price. 

2. Regarding coronavirus it's too early to be leaping on it in the way that you are. It's worth remembering that more people die in the UK from prostate cancer per day than have been diagnosed with coronavirus to date. The problem in China is that panic has led to factory closures which means their high-volume, low-margin manufacturing sector has taken a hammering. The UKs economy is very different. For starters our services based economy can weather workers staying at home without losing all economic output. The little manufacturing we have is high-tech, ultra-low-volume, high-margin stuff is relatively resilient. The bigger risk to the UK is of a global downturn that spreads to the UK economy rather than a virus that kills a few thousand retirees. I make no secret of the fact I work in the NHS and I see considerable capacity to deal with a serious coronavirus outbreak in the UK simply by cancelling the huge volume of elective work. Moreover, I think we are now into March and the warmer weather is likely to constrain the extent of any outbreak here. The ""horror scenario"" of 500,000 deaths is outrageously unlikely. 

3. With regards to the trade negotiations, Its ultimately a process of the EU and UK both reaching a point of equillibrium with one another. I think both will have to accept some hard truths. In the UK it will probably mean us accepting that the EU is going to have some nfluence over our domestic affairs in the years ahead. In the EU is will probably mean accepting that Europes economic stability is dependent on the UKs economic stability, which in turn means accepting that the UK economy NEEDS to be allowed the space to become more competitive, at least in some areas. I suspect the real process of the negotiations is going to be hammering out the specifics of which areas the EU can tolerate more competition in, and which it can't... and likewise in which areas the UK is prepared to accept some ongoing European oversight and which areas it isn't. As before, the focus is on the small flashpoints of disagreement but the vast areas of mutual agreement are easily overlooked. For example there is little reason for both sides not to continue co-operating on justice and policing issues in much the way we have been.",0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0
141,"&gt;Some people, even if they have fallen over a cliff, would, on the way down, shout: “The virus must be dangerous! What else could it be?”

&gt;“People are dying! It’s got to be the virus!”

&gt;How about this? “The ICU hospital wards in Italy are overflowing. It’s the virus.”

&gt;Step back and think. THINK IT THROUGH.

&gt;Watching a recent interview with an Italian public health official, I had the impression that perhaps several thousand new ICU patients were burdening the hospital system in the northern part of the country. Several thousand out of a national population of 60 million.

&gt;Here’s the trick. Before the announcement of the coronavirus epidemic, people who showed up at those hospitals, with flu, flu-like symptoms, lung infections, pneumonia would be placed in the general wards and treated, or even sent home with drugs.

&gt;But now they would, many of them, be called “presumptive cases” of coronavirus, without any tests at all, or after tests which don’t work (see my prior articles on why the diagnostic tests are useless and deceptive). By labeling these patients “contagious coronavirus,” the hospital doctors are forced to send them to the ICU, to “protect others from the infection.”

&gt;Thus, these ICUs are crowded and overflowing.

&gt;The press publishes pictures of the ICUs and the hysteria factor bubbles up a few degrees hotter.

&gt;The press interviews a hospital doctor, and he says, “We’re starting to see a few more children with the virus.” The public reaction? “Incredible! Now even healthy children are getting sick!” I have breaking news. Children do get sick. Like adults, they develop flu-like symptoms. And as with adults, they can now be diagnosed as “presumptive coronavirus cases.”

&gt;“But what about people dying in Italy?” As in other countries, people in Italy do die. They always have. Especially old people, who have all sorts of long-term health problems. Labeling them with “coronavirus” at the last minute doesn’t explain the cause of death.

&gt;“Healthy people in Italy are dying.” Two points here. First, sometimes these healthy people aren’t really healthy at all. And second, if you were healthy, and you were suddenly diagnosed, for no reason, with a virus you believed was dangerous and even deadly, and then you were isolated in an ICU ward, allowed no visitors, perhaps even put on a ventilator, and then treated with highly toxic antiviral drugs, do you think there is a chance you would die?

&gt;The whole aim of stage magic is, as we all know, deflection of attention. The audience is guided to look HERE, while the trick is being executed THERE. Here, a woman is being sawed in half. There, she is escaping from the back of the box.

&gt;In the “epidemic,” HERE is where people are sick and dying and diagnosed. THERE is where a fictional reason is being cooked up to explain why.

&gt;“But…but…Italy, Italy, Italy, people dying, virus, virus…I don’t get it…”

&gt;Yes you do. You’re getting the message the public health officials want to shove into your mind. You’re standing on a street corner watching a pro execute his shell game, and you’re falling for it every time.",1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0
142,"My friend, Mark Swidan, has been detained at the Jiangmen Detention Center for 7.5 years on drug trafficking charges. I know, 1rst thing people assume when they hear ""Drugs"" is guilt. He is far from guilty. 

China makes it a common practice to detain U.S. Citizens, without any proof of their accusations. They do not have due process or jury trials. Judges and appointmented Chinese lawyers does what the government wants. 

He is the longest detained American Citizen in China, without being sentenced or sent to a prison! 
Why? 
Because they know he is innocent, like many others do, and they have kept him as a pawn for leverage over the U.S. Trade Negotiations and South China Sea. 

Google ""Mark Swidan"", and read the credible and fact checked articles from Newsweek by Jeff Stein and duihua.org, a nonprofit focused on Human Rights. Other articles have the facts wrong and only focus on Mark Swidan's drug charge and 2 year DEATH SENTENCE reprieve. Yes, that's right, DEATH SENTENCE. It's been appealed, and China is taking their time with his ""trial"", if you can even call that Circus a trial. 


There is no evidence. He met the men, actually involved with the drug trafficking ring, through a ""friend"" in Houston, TX. This ""friend"" knew he was going to China, on business, and so kindly made the introduction to an ""interpreter"" and ""driver"" to ""help him out"". This ""friend"" is involved with the drug trafficking as well, and used him as a pawn, just like China is. 

Apparently, this is large drug trafficking ring with citizens of Canada, Mexico, and the U.S. involved. 12 people have been arrested and detained. The Chinese High Court does not give each person a trial. It's done by lumping them all together. Those other men are guilty, BUT NOT MARK SWIDAN. 

There is proof he was there for business purposes, which the Chinese High Court won't allow into evidence. What a surprise....
Mark Swidan had nothing to do with this, and had zero knowledge of anything drug related. 

He is only guilty of being in Proximity of the drugs and the 2 men, he hired as a driver and interpreter. GUILTY OF PROXIMITY AND BEING AT THE WRONG PLACE, AT THE WRONG TIME &amp; NOTHING MORE.


He's been starved, tortured, shackled, beaten, denied health care, has slept on a cold concrete floor, and used for slave labor for 7.5 years. All detainees or prisoners, in China, are forced to make the plastic flowers and Christmas ornaments that WE ALL BUY from Walmart/Sam's Club and Hobby Lobby! 

What would you do if this happened to your son, daughter, mother, father, friend, husband, wife, or you?!?!?!

Help a fellow U.S. Citizen, with no criminal background, come back home to Houston, TX! 

What can the American public and Reddit Community do? 

1. Write to the State Department
2. Write to Senators, especially TX Senators Ted Cruz and John Cornyn, and demand they take action to bring one of their constituents home. 
3. Write to the Congessional - Executive Commission on China (CECC) and Sen. Marco Rubio and House Rep. James McGovern. They are members of the CECC. 
(Members are senators and house reps. I am in possession of a letter written &amp; signed by every member of the CECC to POTUS, delivered to him the morning of the Trade Negotiations with China. Mark Swidan was supposed to be 1 of the US Citizens, wrongfully detained, in that letter. It requested POTUS make the release of these US Citizens as part of the Trade Negotiations.)
4. Search #freemarkswidan on Twitter and repost, to make #freemarkswidan trending. 

President Trump demanded China's Dictator, Xi Ping, to release NCAA basketball players, who were actually guilty of theft &amp; breaking the law. They were released and even flew back to the U.S. on AF1. He knows about Mark Swidan, but he hasn't done anything. I guess Mark would have been better off being a basketball player, instead of an artist, photographer, and businessman. 

Great sound bites, from Sec of State and other U.S. government officials, criticizing China for their lack of Human Rights and Due Process, but NO ACTION! 


Now, there's the Corona Virus outbreak, right around the area he is being detained. China detains anyone, for whatever reason. Don't forget, they are a dictatorship and communist country. He could catch this, and they would just let him die! 

Help Mark Swidan come back home to Houston, TX, and allow this innocent man the ability to restart his life again, after much needed healthcare, PTSD care, dental care, sleep on a real bed without deprivation of sleep, rest from slave labor, and more than 1 bowl of rice per day, without dog meat. 

I know every detail of his case. I'm close with his mother. We speak daily. I know things that China would never allow the public to know. I am in constant contact with the Consular General in Guangzhou, China. 

Mark is only allowed 1 visit per month from the Consular. Consulars fo not have the power to do much except visit, facilitate, and deliver letters and packages we send to Mark. It takes almost 2 months before Mark is able to receive our things vice versa. They translate every letter and inspect all items. We only receive letters back and forth, if there are no disparaging comments about China or references to his case. 


I JUST received a very long letter from Mark last week. It was written and delivered to the High Court in early November. WTF? THIS WHOLE THING IS LIKE A RIDICULOUS MOVIE.

Fellow U.S. Citizens and Reddit Community, please please take 10 mins to fully read this comment and google Mark Swidan to read Newsweek and duihua.org articles about this. 

Only U.S. Citizens can make them do it, especially during this 2020 election year. Please write to everyone I listed above and make Hashtag Freemarkswidan trend on every social channel. 

People hear about these things, and think, ""That's terrible."" Then they go on living their lives. I have listed things ALL OF YOU CAN DO. PLEASE. 

Only our government can get him home. We MUST pressure them to ensure Mark Swidan is brought home this 2020 election year!!!!!!!

Beijing Knows Who to Blame for the Virus: America

The outbreak has caused a PR crisis for China.

BY JAMES PALMER | MARCH 2, 2020, 8:44 PM

￼

U.S. President Donald Trump and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar meet with pharmaceutical executives to discuss the coronavirus in Washington on March 2. MANDEL NGAN/AFP/GETTY IMAGES

Amid a national lockdown, desperate patients, anger at a cover-up, an economic crisis, and a virus breaking beyond its own borders, the Chinese government’s priorities were clear: It was time to publish a glossy book on how wonderful Beijing’s handling of the virus has been.
A Battle Against Epidemic: China Combating COVID-19 in 2020 compiles numerous state media accounts on the heroic leadership of President Xi Jinping, the vital role of the Communist Party, and the superiority of the Chinese system in fighting the virus. It has gotten rave reviews in Chinese media, not least because it was published by their ultimate boss—the Central Committee Publicity Department, formerly known as the Propaganda Department.
The Chinese audience won’t be the only lucky readers. The book will be translated into English, French, Spanish, Russian and Arabic, with more likely to follow. Authorities know the virus could irreparably damage China’s image in the world s eyes, but they also see an opportunity to push their own narrative of organization, success, and triumph. Part of that involves glossy propaganda texts, combined with more sophisticated, individually targeted efforts. Part of it is pushing a new set of conspiracy theories about the virus itself, aimed at the ultimate enemy: the United States.
The downside of the epidemic for China’s image is obvious. There are legitimate reasons: The cover-up of the early extent of the outbreak by authorities more concerned with politics than pandemics gave it critical time to spread. But the Chinese government is also likely to be blamed for events outside its control, especially as patients and casualties pile up.Authorities know the virus could irreparably damage China’s image in the world’s eyes, but they also see an opportunity to push their own narrative.
The damage to China’s economy and image is also seriously worrying the leadership, which has been attempting to push people back to work. That damage is already visible in the United States, where the virus has pushed opinions of China to record lows—and made people less confident in China’s economic future. Firms were already looking for suppliers outside of China as a result of the trade war; the coronavirus is giving that a critical push.
Yet Beijing is pushing a powerful counternarrative: the idea that Chinese organization and authoritarianism allowed for a rapid and effective response to the crisis that other countries can learn from. The export of authoritarian techniques has been one of the underrated selling points of China’s global projects in the past few years, especially in Central Asia. The primary audience, as always, is domestic—but it includes foreigners too, especially in developing countries.
In fairness, it may be that the widspread lockdown truly played a critical role in containing the virus. Yet it’s hard to know for sure because of the government-led clampdown on reporting, as well as the introduction of yet another set of new media and Internet controls, already planned before the coronavirus. At the provincial level, statistics on the outbreak range from the dubious to the obviously false.  Disturbingly, the World Health Organization, already facing public criticism for its refusal to confront Chinese failures, is a willing participant in pushing that narrative, writing a comically sycophantic report on Chinese efforts based on a recent managed propaganda tour of Hubei province, where the virus first erupted.
Much of this is clumsily obvious and will have little effect on audiences with no obligation to pretend Xi’s speeches are rhetorical masterpieces. But other parts of Chinese outreach are far smarter and more sophisticated, drawing on the country’s huge linguistic and diplomatic resources when it comes to Africa and the Middle East in particular. Take this video produced by China Radio International that’s been widely circulated on Telegram in Iran, in which a fluent Farsi speaker explains how China managed the outbreak, and offers help to Iran, one of the countries outside China most affected by the outbreak. That’s the kind of engagement that can make a lasting difference to ordinary people rather than fellow autocrats.
From early on, there’s also been a deliberate doubling-down on anti-U.S. propaganda. In part that was an almost instinctive reaction; anti-Americanism has so come to dominate the Chinese media in the last four years that it’s the default position for writers. Even in the early weeks of the outbreak, Chinese officials were blaming the United States for supposed overreaction and falsely claiming Washington was the first to impose travel bans. But there’s also a clear desire to divert anger away from officialdom and toward an external foe.The fact that these stories stay up in China shows that, at the very least, the government is tolerating them.
The next stage of the propaganda push has been to deny that the virus started in China at all. (Quite how the virus crossed species is still unclear, but there’s nothing to suggest it didn’t happen in China, which saw the first outbreak in the city of Wuhan.) Those claims erupted on Chinese social media last week, where conspiracy-minded sites such as College Daily, already vectors for deeply racist and Islamophobic stories winked at by the propaganda authorities, are pushing the idea that the virus really originated in the United States. Clips from Taiwanese TV and mistranslated captions from American reporting are used to back up the case.
They’re helped in this by China’s own bad recording of flu stats, which makes it appear as though the country has only had a few hundred seasonal flu deaths this year, when in reality 84,000 to 92,000 people in China die of the flu each year. Claims of the deadliness of American flu appeared in January, leading to officials believing that U.S. reporters didn’t fear the coronavirus because they were inured to the disease. The explicit claim that coronavirus started in the United States is relatively new, but—judging from reported conversations between Chinese abroad and their parents and grandparents at home—has spread disturbingly fast. Flu isn’t the only culprit blamed; one other popular theory is that vaping deaths under President Donald Trump were a cover for coronavirus fatalities.

Taiwan Wants to Help Fight the Coronavirus. WHO Won’t Let It.

It’s unclear how much of this is state-sanctioned. The United States, of course, has hardly been short of conspiracy theories of its own about the virus. While he walked it back later, Trump himself described the virus as “fake news.” Arkansas Republican Sen. Tom Cotton has also played a part in spreading them. But the United States doesn’t have thousands of government and private-sector personnel dedicated to online censorship, who block key search terms and take down stories and rumors unfavorable to the government with lightning speed.
The fact that these stories stay up in China shows that, at the very least, the government is tolerating them. Most worryingly, top Chinese epidemiologist Zhong Nanshan, who has been at the front and center of the response to the outbreak, recently made an enigmatic claim at a press conference that the virus may not have originated in China—winking at these conspiracy theories without explicitly endorsing them.
Even more than boasts about China’s effectiveness, conspiracy theories are targeted at a domestic audience, as well as the Chinese diaspora. But they’re likely to be embraced elsewhere, especially in countries with their own tendency to spot U.S. plots everywhere.
If the coronavirus is uncontainable, as many epidemiologists fear, the whole world is going to be looking for someone to blame—and Beijing wants to make sure that blame falls on Washington.

145,"&gt;On 17 January my muscles became sore all over. I may have had a slight fever, but it wasn’t strong enough to notice. Looking back, it is a little scary, because my house and the language school where I study Japanese are within a 5km radius of the Wuhan seafood market (where the virus is believed to have originated).

&gt;To treat my muscle soreness, I took some cold tablets because I thought it was a normal cold. Now that I think of it, I might have missed the best time for treatment, failing to contain the virus with antiviral drugs in its early stages.

&gt;I have no idea how I got the virus. I always eat at the same Hong Kong-style restaurant below my school. I wasn’t walking around much at the time because it was very cold, and since I was tired after classes I always went back home. Once the semester break started, I stayed with my parents and not at the dormitory. I started wearing a mask a few days later when I saw everyone else around me wearing masks.

&gt;By 21 January my body was still aching all over, so I called my dad. He sensed something was wrong with me and urged me to go home immediately. That evening I took my body temperature which showed a mild fever. My mom said that if my temperature still didn’t drop later that night, we would go to the hospital. At 11pm that night, the fever hadn’t gone away, so I went to Tongji hospital.

&gt;On arrival I saw the hospital already overwhelmed with patients. Seeing doctors in their hazmat suits in real life for the first time, something I’d only seen in documentaries about Sars, I realised something bad was happening.

&gt;I wasn’t that astonished or scared when I saw all the people, because it is one of the best hospitals in Wuhan and it is always very crowded. Because of the massive crowds, I decided to go to Wuhan pulmonary hospital instead, and that proved to be the right decision.

&gt;There was not a single patient there at the time I arrived. There I had blood and liver function [tests] and a CT scan. The CT results came back showing patchy shadows on the lower sides of both of my lungs. I started to take some prescription medicine and Chinese medicine capsules prescribed by the hospital.

&gt;When Wuhan started to be locked down, that’s when my dad had me quarantine myself at home. I also knew from watching movies and things that we should probably stock up on food at home, so we bought a bunch of instant noodles, which no one ended up eating. There was enough at the supermarket; the only thing we really couldn’t find was disinfectants.

&gt;My father is an office worker at a drug company and my mom went to school at a medical university, so they were good with helping analyse my situation. I started to self-isolate on 22 January. My room has its own tub and bathroom, so it is pretty convenient. My grandma did the cooking for me and when she brought food in, she would wear a mask and we’d use disposable chopsticks and things like that, so after I was done that all got thrown out.

&gt;On 25 January I had a checkup. I had begun to cough. It was a very dry cough with a little yellow phlegm. The results showed that my situation was worsening, with the infection spreading to my entire lungs. The doctor gave me an IV drip, while the oral medicine remained the same. At the time the doctor told me I was suspected of having the virus, but that only an expert committee could decide who would be able to use the testing kit.

&gt;By 26 January getting up had become extremely difficult and I was shivering with cold. I felt I was having a high fever, and I was: 39C. Reports later said that the situation could develop extremely fast in the middle stage, but before I knew it, by that evening the fever was gone. It felt like having been to hell and back. That period from 21 January to the 26th was the worst time. I coughed so bad my stomach was hurting and my back ached. Those were some of the worst days in my life.

&gt;It was then that I realised I needed some spiritual support or maybe I couldn’t make it. So I watched my favourite anime show and seeing their normal, happy lives, I thought I may have to say goodbye to this life forever. But watching the show, the heroine had troubles in the first half, but she finally made it and succeeded in her career.

&gt;You see, I was going to fly to Japan in mid-February to go to a concert by Ayaka Ohashi, a Japanese voice actress and anime artist, but with the lockdown I thought everything might be cancelled. I had attended her solo performance last year, and after watching her I had decided I wanted to make a career out of managing voice actors. So watching the show, I thought: I must make it if I want to see her next concert alive. This really encouraged me and gave me some relief, along with the medicine. I dreamed twice that week that I met her.

&gt;I had another re-exam on 28 January, which showed both my lungs were getting better. After a medical consultation between the doctors, they decided I was qualified for being tested for the coronavirus.

&gt;My elder brother began to have a fever and cough on the 29th. His exam results showed there were small patches of glass-like shadows in his lungs. He was considered a suspected case. On the same day, my grandma also had a fever. As for me, my test results were positive and I was officially a confirmed case. The hospital gave me five days of an anti-HIV medicine for free, while my family were also starting to take prescribed medicine. Due to my improved situation and limited beds in the hospital, I was told to go home and isolate myself, and thus my IV therapy ended.

&gt;My brother had a re-exam and he tested positive on 2 February. My grandmother had a fever for four days but then recovered. She was never tested, and neither was my mother, but they all took medicine. My brother also eventually recovered and is now negative for the virus.

&gt;On 4 February, a CT scan showed continued improvements in my lungs, and my cough stopped. I was given another coronavirus test and prescribed more medicine. The next day test results showed I was negative for the virus, but according to instructions from the doctors, I needed to go back for another test. On 7 February results showed again that I was negative, and I was declared recovered.",0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0

&gt; **Schoolgirl with suspected viral illness in Potsdam clinic**

&gt; In Brandenburg, a girl could have been infected with corona viruses. The number of deaths in China increases to 170.

&gt; Potsdam is now also suspected of being infected with the corona virus . This was announced by Potsdam Mayor Mike Schubert (SPD) in the city council. The patient is currently in the Potsdam Bergmann Clinic.
&gt; 
&gt; Damaris Hunsmann, spokeswoman for the Bergmann Clinic , told the ""Potsdamer Neuesten Nachrichten"" on request that the patient was already treated in an isolated room in the emergency room and then transferred to the infectious disease. A rapid test, which will be evaluated at the Charité, should bring certainty by Thursday.
&gt; 
&gt; The virus continues to spread rapidly. As the Chinese health authority announced on Thursday, the total number of deaths rose from 38 to 170. The number of confirmed sufferers rose to 7,711 cases in China. After Tibet also reported the first illness, infections have now been detected in all regions and provinces of China . Even France announced another infection.
&gt; 
&gt; Lufthansa announced on Wednesday that it would cancel all flights to and from China. Europe's largest airline with its daughters is following its competitor British Airways and other airlines in view of the novel corona virus, as the company confirmed on Wednesday in Frankfurt.
&gt; 
&gt; The number of cases of coronavirus disease in China is now significantly higher than it was in the Sars epidemic . In China alone, almost 8,000 cases have now been recorded. According to the official balance sheet, 5327 people were affected by the Sars virus in mainland China in 2002 and 2003.
&gt; 
&gt; There are currently four confirmed diseases with the virus in Germany.

From Berliner Zeitung - https://www.bz-berlin.de/berlin/umland/coronavirus-verdacht-in-potsdam
 
&gt; After the Chinese-born student noticed flu-like symptoms, she reported to the doctor. On Wednesday evening she went to the isolation station. Corona virus suspected!
&gt; 
&gt; In  the evening in  Potsdam-Fahrland , an ambulance with personnel in protective suits drove up to the patient's house. The girl from the private Schillergymnasium had flu-like symptoms and was brought to the Ernst von Bergmann Clinic and isolated there. Health tests are ongoing. A quick test is evaluated in the Berlin Charité. A result is expected in the late Thursday afternoon.
&gt; 
&gt; ""As far as we know, the person had no contact with the risk area,"" Gabriel Hesse, spokesman for the Brandenburg Ministry of Health told BZ. The girl lives with three roommates in Potsdam, and they are isolated at home until the test result is available. 
&gt; 
&gt; A statement from the school states: ""Since the student has not been to school for several days, there is no risk of infection from staying in the school building."" However, the school leaves its students free to stay at home until a finding is available.

147,"&gt;Its full name is Centro de Mayores Santísima Virgen y San Celedonio [""Most Holy Virgin and St. Celedonius's Elderly Care Center']. It is located in Madrid, on Calle Condes del Val 11, just a few blocks from the Santiago Bernabéu. And unfortunately for the elderly living and receiving care there, it is a new mousetrap because of the Covid-19 virus infection. The first resident to die was eleven days ago. And since then, the number has continued to rise. They are already twelve and with no solution in sight, as family and workers denounce.

&gt;Before San Celedonio, supervised by a foundation of the Archbishopric of Madrid, became a place of death, it has come to house 163 residents. As of today, the complex has 145 elderly people, of whom 30 are isolated with clear symptoms, five in serious condition, and another ten have initial symptoms. In total, the coronavirus has a third in quarantine and the other two at risk of contagion.

&gt;The situation is critical. Five deceased arrived at the hospital, where they tested positive for Covid-19. Seven others have done so at the residence with clear symptoms, but without diagnosis. ""For days in the Community of Madrid, hospitals have not accepted referrals of people from residences with cognitive impairment and in a very serious clinical situation,"" explains a director of the residence with regret. ""The virus is widespread and uncontrolled.""

&gt;The pattern of San Celedonio is similar to that of other nursing homes that have become sources of infection. ""There are no necessary means for the care that older people require,"" acknowledges another worker, who also denounces the exposure of the staff that cares for the elderly on a permanent basis. 50% of the workforce is in quarantine and only half of the places have been filled. ""We lack staff"".

&gt;Call for help

&gt;The appeal of the management team to the Archbishopric has been unsuccessful. Or too late. Or all at once. Last Sunday, March 8, the General Directorate of Public Health of the Community of Madrid issued an instruction to all nursing homes in the region, public and private, to limit visits in order to reduce the risk of coronavirus infection . On that date, there were only eight deaths from the virus.

&gt;The elderly have been the first to fall into the hands of the Covid-19. On Friday March 6, a week before the announcement of the state of alarm, Madrid closed the 213 senior centers in the region after the death of the two elderly. Until that moment, the deceased were over 73 years old and had previous pathologies. Since then, the foci in residences have multiplied: Madrid, Valdemoro, Torrejón, Morata de Tajuña...

&gt;Lack of resources

&gt;In the case of San Celedonio, the situation has become more complicated every day. As the number of infected increased, the number of workers fell, in addition to suffering from the lack of adequate material for this eventuality, like most centers with these characteristics. It had a specialized Alzheimer's and dementias unit, as well as specialized geriatric staff, but all that has been useless.

&gt;The situation is so critical that yesterday, the Minister of Health, Salvador Illa, put forward a protocol (future ministerial order) of action for the health professionals of these centers. For his part, the second vice-president Pablo Iglesias announced a financial aid package to reinforce home care for the elderly; maintain and increase the staffing of social centers and nursing homes; and assist homeless people.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0

The problem is China. For the second time in 20 years they have put us all in danger.

China is a backwards country. Large swaths of the country are poor and dilapidated.

If China didn't lie about the virus. If they didn't lie about the numbers. If they didn't pretend that only Hubei was the problem then maybe the rest of the world wouldn't be in this predicament.

Congratulations this sub for being on top of things.

There Is a ‘Tipping Point’ Before Coronavirus Kills

By

Covid-19’s trek to lower respiratory tract marks severe phase

Progression from mild or moderate to severe can occur quickly

The new coronavirus causes little more than a cough if it stays in [the nose](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2001737) and throat, which it does for the majority of people unlucky enough to be infected. Danger starts when it reaches the lungs.

One in seven patients develops difficulty breathing and other severe complications, while 6% become critical. These patients typically suffer failure of the respiratory and other vital systems, and sometimes develop septic shock, according to a [report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf) by last month’s joint [World Health Organization](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/0751538D:SW)-China mission.

The progression from mild or moderate to severe can occur “very, very quickly,” said Bruce Aylward, a WHO assistant director-general who co-led a mission in China that reviewed data from 56,000 cases. Understanding the course of the disease and identifying individuals at greatest risk are critical for optimizing care for a global contagion that’s killed more than 3,500 people since emerging in central China in December.

About 10-15% of mild-to-moderate patients progress to severe and of those, 15-20% progress to critical. Patients at highest risk include people age 60 and older and those with pre-existing conditions such as hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

Hardest Hit

Almost 15% of patients in their 80s succumb after contracting the coronavirus

Note: Based on 44,6723 confirmed cases through Feb. 11

“The clinical picture suggests a pattern of disease that’s not dissimilar to what we might see in influenza,” said [Jeffery K. Taubenberger](https://irp.nih.gov/pi/jeffery-taubenberger), who studied the infection in Spanish flu victims, including one exhumed more than 20 years ago from permafrost in northwestern Alaska.
Covid-19 most likely spreads via contact with virus-laden droplets expelled from an infected person’s cough, sneeze or breath.

[Can I Get It? What’s Known About Virus Transmission: QuickTake](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-21/how-the-novel-coronavirus-can-maybe-infect-you-quicktake)
Infection generally starts in the nose. Once inside the body, the coronavirus invades the epithelial cells that line and protect the respiratory tract, said Taubenberger, who heads the viral pathogenesis and evolution section of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Maryland. If it’s contained in the upper airway, it usually results in a less severe disease.

But if the virus treks down the windpipe to the peripheral branches of the respiratory tree and lung tissue, it can trigger a more severe phase of the disease. That’s due to the pneumonia-causing damage inflicted directly by the virus plus secondary damage caused by the body’s immune response to the infection.
“Your body is immediately trying to repair the damage in the lung as soon as it’s happening,” Taubenberger said. Various white blood cells that consume pathogens and help heal damaged tissue act as first-responders. “Normally, if this goes well, you can clear up your infection in just a few days.”
In some more-severe coronavirus infections, the body’s effort to heal itself may be too robust, leading to the destruction of not just virus-infected cells, but healthy tissue, Taubenberger said. Damage to the epithelium lining the trachea and bronchi can result in the loss of protective mucus-producing cells as well as the tiny hairs, or cilia, that sweep dirt and respiratory secretions out of the lungs.
“You have no ability to keep stuff out of the lower respiratory tract,” Taubenberger said. As a result, the lungs are vulnerable to an invasive secondary bacterial infection. Potential culprits include the germs normally harbored in the nose and throat, and the antibiotic-resistant bacteria that thrive in [hospitals](https://aac.asm.org/content/60/10/6115), especially the moist environments of mechanical ventilators.
[What You Need to Know About the Spreading Coronavirus: QuickTake](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-07/how-china-s-mystery-illness-is-and-isn-t-like-sars-quicktake)
Secondary bacterial infections represent an especially pernicious threat because they can kill critical respiratory tract stem cells that enable tissue to rejuvenate. Without them, “you just can’t physically repair your lungs,” Taubenberger said. Damaged lungs can starve vital organs of oxygen, impairing the kidneys, liver, brain and heart.

“When you get a bad, overwhelming infection, everything starts to fall apart in a cascade,” said David Morens, senior scientific adviser to the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. “You pass the tipping point where everything is going downhill and, at some point, you can’t get it back.”
That tipping point probably also occurs earlier in older people, as it does in experiments with older mice, said [Stanley Perlman](https://medicine.uiowa.edu/microbiology/profile/stanley-perlman), a professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Iowa in Iowa City, who has studied coronaviruses for 38 years.

Still, even healthy younger adults have succumbed to the illness. [Li Wenliang](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-18/china-doctor-dies-as-virus-takes-toll-on-medics-at-ground-zero), the 34-year-old ophthalmologist who was one of the first to warn about the coronavirus in Wuhan, died last month after receiving antibodies, antivirals, antibiotics, oxygen and having his blood pumped through an artificial lung.
Some people may be more genetically susceptible, possibly because they have a greater abundance of the distinctly shaped protein receptors in their respiratory epithelial cells that the virus targets, Taubenberger said. It’s also possible certain individuals have some minor immunodeficiency or other host factors that relate to underlying illnesses.",0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
150,"Here's a frightening scenario from Cristina Higgins in Italy

I am writing to you from Bergamo, Italy, at the heart of the coronavirus crisis. The news media in the US has not captured the severity of what is happening here. I am writing this post because each of you, today, not the government, not the school district, not the mayor, each individual citizen has the chance, today to take actions that will deter the Italian situation from becoming your own country’s reality.  The only way to stop this virus is to limit contagion. And the only way to limit contagion is for millions of people to change their behavior today. 

If you are in Europe or the US you are weeks away from where we are today in Italy.

I can hear you now. “It’s just a flu. It only affects old people with preconditions”

There are 2 reasons why Coronavirus has brought Italy to it’s knees. First it is a flu is devastating when people get really sick they need weeks of ICU – and, second, because of how fast and effectively it spreads. There is 2 week incubation period and many who have it never show symptoms.  

When Prime Minister Conte announced last night that the entire country, 60 million people, would go on lock down, the line that struck me most was “there is no more time.” Because to be clear, this national lock down, is a hail mary. What he means is that if the numbers of contagion do not start to go down, the system, Italy, will collapse. 

Why? Today the ICUs in Lombardy are at capacity – more than capacity. They have begun to put ICU units in the hallways. If the numbers do not go down, the growth rate of contagion tells us that there will be thousands of people who in a matter of a week? two weeks? who will need care. What will happen when there are 100, or a 1000 people who need the hospital and only a few ICU places left? 

On Monday a doctor wrote in the paper that they have begun to have to decide who lives and who dies when the patients show up in the emergency room, like what is done in war. This will only get worse. 

There are a finite number of drs, nurses, medical staff and they are getting the virus. They have also been working non-stop, non-stop for days and days. What happens when the drs, nurses and medical staff are simply not able to care for the patients, when they are not there?

And finally for those who say that this is just something that happens to old people, starting yesterday the hospitals are reporting that younger and younger patients – 40, 45, 18, are coming in for treatment. 

You have a chance to make a difference and stop the spread in your country. Push for the entire office to work at home today, cancel birthday parties, and other gatherings, stay home as much as you can. If you have a fever, any fever, stay home. Push for school closures, now. Anything you can do to stop the spread, because it is spreading in your communities – there is a two week incubation period – and if you do these things now you can buy your medical system time. 

And for those who say it is not possible to close the schools, and do all these other things, locking down Italy was beyond anyone’s imagination a week ago. 

Soon you will not have a choice, so do what you can now.

To my knowledge it's not been definitively proven however this is the 4 th or 5th individual case reported recently, and there was one study [non peer revied] that suggested up to 14% of the patients in the study were either reinfected or relapsed. They still cant rule out secondary infection source to say 100% the patients are actually relapsing but imo either way it's a concerning thought

One absolutely different thing to consider is possible antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of viral entry for coronaviruses, there was some quite recent and serious academical science study on such phenomenon:

&gt; ADE has been observed for coronaviruses. Several studies have shown that sera induced by SARS-CoV spike enhance viral entry into Fc-receptor-expressing cells. Further, one study demonstrated that unlike receptor-dependent viral entry, sera dependent SARS-CoV entry does not go through the endosome pathway.
&gt; Additionally, it has long been known that **immunization of cats with feline coronavirus spike leads to worsened future infection due to the induction of infection-enhancing antibodies**. However, detailed molecular mechanisms for ADE of coronavirus entry are still unknown.

What it might mean in practice:

&gt; 
&gt; It’s highly possible to get infected a second time,” one of the doctors, who declined to be identified, told the outlet.
&gt; 
&gt; The physician said that medication used to treat the virus can have negative side effects on patients’ heart tissue, making them more susceptible to cardiac arrest.
&gt; 
&gt; “A few people recovered from the first time by their own immune system, but the meds [sic] they use are damaging their heart tissue, and **when they get it the second time, the antibody doesn’t help but makes it worse**, and they die a sudden death from heart failure,” the doctor said.

So initially most cases may be so mild that most people in US will just brush it off as bad, but simple flu and then get reinfected with way worse consequences, but it will take some time inevitably to really confirm such turn of events.

And, this study: First Case of 2019 Novel Coronavirus in the United States 

35 year old male - symptom progression day 1-12

https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001191


On January 19, 2020, a 35-year-old man presented to an urgent care clinic in Snohomish County, Washington, with a 4-day history of cough and subjective fever. On checking into the clinic, the patient put on a mask in the waiting room. After waiting approximately 20 minutes, he was taken into an examination room and underwent evaluation by a provider. He disclosed that he had returned to Washington State on January 15 after traveling to visit family in Wuhan, China. The patient stated that he had seen a health alert from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) about the novel coronavirus outbreak in China and, because of his symptoms and recent travel, decided to see a health care provider....

Given the patient’s travel history, the local and state health departments were immediately notified. Together with the urgent care clinician, the Washington Department of Health notified the CDC Emergency Operations Center. Although the patient reported that he had not spent time at the Huanan seafood market and reported no known contact with ill persons during his travel to China, CDC staff concurred with the need to test the patient for 2019-nCoV on the basis of current CDC “persons under investigation” case definitions.8 Specimens were collected in accordance with CDC guidance and included serum and nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens. After specimen collection, the patient was discharged to home isolation with active monitoring by the local health department.
On January 20, 2020, the CDC confirmed that the patient’s nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs tested positive for 2019-nCoV by real-time reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction (rRT-PCR) assay. In coordination with CDC subject-matter experts, state and local health officials, emergency medical services, and hospital leadership and staff, the patient was admitted to an airborne-isolation unit at Providence Regional Medical Center for clinical observation, with health care workers following CDC recommendations for contact, droplet, and airborne precautions with eye protection.

On admission, the patient reported persistent dry cough and a 2-day history of nausea and vomiting; he reported that he had no shortness of breath or chest pain. Vital signs were within normal ranges. On physical examination, the patient was found to have dry mucous membranes. The remainder of the examination was generally unremarkable. After admission, the patient received supportive care, including 2 liters of normal saline and ondansetron for nausea.


On days 2 through 5 of hospitalization (days 6 through 9 of illness), the patient’s vital signs remained largely stable, apart from the development of intermittent fevers accompanied by periods of tachycardia (Figure 2). The patient continued to report a nonproductive cough and appeared fatigued. On the afternoon of hospital day 2, the patient passed a loose bowel movement and reported abdominal discomfort. A second episode of loose stool was reported overnight; a sample of this stool was collected for rRT-PCR testing, along with additional respiratory specimens (nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal) and serum. The stool and both respiratory specimens later tested positive by rRT-PCR for 2019-nCoV, whereas the serum remained negative.

Treatment during this time was largely supportive. For symptom management, the patient received, as needed, antipyretic therapy consisting of 650 mg of acetaminophen every 4 hours and 600 mg of ibuprofen every 6 hours. He also received 600 mg of guaifenesin for his continued cough and approximately 6 liters of normal saline over the first 6 days of hospitalization.


A chest radiograph taken on hospital day 3 (illness day 7) was reported as showing no evidence of infiltrates or abnormalities (Figure 3). However, a second chest radiograph from the night of hospital day 5 (illness day 9) showed evidence of pneumonia in the lower lobe of the left lung (Figure 4). These radiographic findings coincided with a change in respiratory status starting on the evening of hospital day 5, when the patient’s oxygen saturation values as measured by pulse oximetry dropped to as low as 90% while he was breathing ambient air. On day 6, the patient was started on supplemental oxygen, delivered by nasal cannula at 2 liters per minute. Given the changing clinical presentation and concern about hospital-acquired pneumonia, treatment with vancomycin (a 1750-mg loading dose followed by 1 g administered intravenously every 8 hours) and cefepime (administered intravenously every 8 hours) was initiated.


On hospital day 6 (illness day 10), a fourth chest radiograph showed basilar streaky opacities in both lungs, a finding consistent with atypical pneumonia (Figure 5), and rales were noted in both lungs on auscultation. Given the radiographic findings, the decision to administer oxygen supplementation, the patient’s ongoing fevers, the persistent positive 2019-nCoV RNA at multiple sites, and published reports of the development of severe pneumonia3,4 at a period consistent with the development of radiographic pneumonia in this patient, clinicians pursued compassionate use of an investigational antiviral therapy. Treatment with intravenous remdesivir (a novel nucleotide analogue prodrug in development10,11) was initiated on the evening of day 7, and no adverse events were observed in association with the infusion. Vancomycin was discontinued on the evening of day 7, and cefepime was discontinued on the following day, after serial negative procalcitonin levels and negative nasal PCR testing for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

On hospital day 8 (illness day 12), the patient’s clinical condition improved. Supplemental oxygen was discontinued, and his oxygen saturation values improved to 94 to 96% while he was breathing ambient air. The previous bilateral lower-lobe rales were no longer present. His appetite improved, and he was asymptomatic aside from intermittent dry cough and rhinorrhea. 

As of January 30, 2020, the patient remains hospitalized. He is afebrile, and all symptoms have resolved with the exception of his cough, which is decreasing in severity.

(The above referenced patient survived and was released from hospital and “remains isolated at home.”) see;

Why I wear a mask - and you should too 

You might be wondering what you can do. It’s simple - everyone wears a mask. 

“Psst...I’m healthy - I don’t need a mask”  “The government says to sneeze into your elbow!”  I answer all of those concerns below.

“I’m healthy - I don’t need a mask (because I’ve got a great immune system)”.  Sure. But this is a brand-new virus. No one has any antibodies built up to this. 

Government solution is to sneeze into your elbow.

Government solutions do not include masks...even DIY masks in any of their recommendations.  Even though masks are recommended for respiratory diseases which is what CoVid-19 is.

CDC

The CDC [reports](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/transmission.html) the two main causes of the spread of SARS-COV2 (the coronavirus) are via:

""Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).""

""Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.""

The [CDC does recommend masks.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/guidance-prevent-spread.html)..for the sick.  

Everyone should wear masks - but just saying the sick only should wear it,  just stigmatizes those who do wear masks.

The CDC has said over and over that only the sick should wear a mask.  Now, anyone wearing a mask is thought to be sick, although they just might be trying to protect themselves.

Those who have SARS-COV-2 either think they have the flu or they have no symptoms.  So, they are spreading the disease just breathing, coughing, and sneezing.

Washington State Governor Inslee has recommended elbow bumps.  [Per the WHO, that is incorrect](https://nypost.com/2020/03/08/world-health-organization-official-gives-thumbs-down-on-bumping-elbows/) because you are then too close and breathing in each other's breath,[which travels up to 6 feet](https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/778674).  Let me rephrase that - Washington State Governor Islee’s misguided elbow bump is directly leading to the spread of infection, flood of victims to the hospital - and to Americans’ deaths.

All public health organizations today recommend - some version of the following 

[￼](https://kitsappublichealth.org/CommunityHealth/CoronaVirus.php)

These are good - but are missing the crucial step of wearing a mask.

Everyone should wear masks.  They work by stopping respiratory droplets of the virus when we sneeze, cough, and even breath.

Masks do work

[Here ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4293989/)is one study showing that Masks DO work, and [here’s ](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/65/11/1934/4068747)is another study also proving this.  

But the CDC says masks don’t work.  What they really mean is that the typical person has not been trained in fitting the N95 type of mask (the white ones with the piece of metal across the bridge of the nose.  Also, that the typical person will take them off incorrectly, contaminating themselves in the process.

[How to fit ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOyFmdjxNM)an N95 mask.

[How to safely take off ](https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/hcp/ppe-training/n95respirator_coveralls/doffing_16.html)an N95 mask directly from the CDC.

And let’s get to the real reason -  the CDC is clearly not promoting masks because they want them saved for healthcare workers.

But!  There are supply chains just for healthcare workers.  They have direct access to medline.com. Their work supplies them..

And most masks have been already sold out in our community.  

So what can we do?  WE WANT MASKS! No problem - you can actually make your own DIY Mask.  

They are not as efficient as N95 masks, but [any mask is better than nothing](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258525804_Testing_the_Efficacy_of_Homemade_Masks_Would_They_Protect_in_an_Influenza_Pandemic) to stop the involuntary coughs and sneezes. 

Studies indicate that they are 68% as effective as a surgical mask.  Which isn’t as good as a top of the line N95 mask. But it’s better than nothing. 

Most importantly, if everyone is wearing a mask, and the other person sneezes, the virus will be largely contained within the mask. 

Does that mean you should walk up to someone having a sneezing fit and have them sneeze on you to test your DIY mask?  Of course not! Your mask is designed to stop you from sneezing and coughing on others - as is their mask. If you are too close, you are likely to get a gust of SARS-COV-2 around your face.  You get one chance to not catch this virus

Making a mask in pandemics is the American thing to do:

in the[ Spanish Flu Pandemic of 1918](https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/influenza-epidemic/), people made [their own masks](https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/influenza-epidemic/records-list.html).  

[Here's a very easy to make mask.](https://youtu.be/aNjpH5lBZ8w)

Here’s another [one](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3373043/).

You have probably noticed that I keep mentioning sneezes and coughs.

That’s because the typical sneeze travel up to [25 feet](https://www.thesun.co.uk/living/1678217/grim-slow-motion-video-reveals-germs-can-be-propelled-25-feet-away-when-you-sneeze/) at [100 mph](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/heres-how-far-and-how-fast-a-sneeze-carries-contagious-germs).  The typical cough [travels 18 feet.](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/heres-how-far-and-how-fast-a-sneeze-carries-contagious-germs)

Approximately 40% of all sneezes and coughs are [involuntary](https://www.verywellhealth.com/chronic-cough-914895).  This is why sneezing/coughing into the elbow is a good idea - but not good enough.

Masks are most important, but until everyone wears them, then it is recommended to wear goggles in case someone sneezes or cough.

The below video of sneezes shows why goggles are a good idea as well.  The Coronavirus targets mucus membranes - which are in your eye cavities as well.   The best googles are ones that have no holes in them - like swimming goggles. 

Just imagine your eyeballs in front of this person sneezing the coronavirus into them...

Want to know what else people can do to really HELP?

We know there will be a shortage of ICU beds with mechanical ventilators.

We need a LOT more people working to make ventilators McGyver style out of readily available materials, fast and cheap and in quantity. BEFORE people start dying because we don't have enough!!!

I don't mean a few hundred either, we will need THOUSANDS.

Run some numbers:

a city of 1 million.

10% infection

80% have mild-moderate symptoms

... but 20% have SEVERE-CRITICAL

1/2 of the 20% need to be hospitalized. 20,000

30% of those hospitalized need some form of breathing assistance. 10,000

In a city of that size there may be 250-300 ventilators. Assume that they can beg/borrow a few from other parts of the country that are not hit hard yet. add 200 or so and raise the total available to 500. OR keep the numbers the same (250) ... but assume some patients only need extra oxygen not a ventilator)

If you can hospitalize 500 on extra oxygen and ventilators, that leaves 2,500 people...

2,500 is about 2.5 % of the total infected 100,000.

China claimed a national average of about 2% mortality. Think about it. Now add this: In the area with the fewest cases, the mortality was significantly under 1%. (I want to say .28% but I am not sure.) They obviously didn't run short of ventilators there. In the area with the most corona virus cases, mortality was over 4% because health care broke down. They were overwhelmed.

Washington state is in the same position now as Italy 2 weeks ago. They have stopped accepting new patients at some hospitals now. Remember online pictures of a hospital in China that locked their doors? They could not handle any more. There are (long standing) Federal and state guidelines on when and how to do the same thing here. It will happen.

In Italy, some people unintentionally spread the virus out of a major city by sending their kids to stay with grandparents until things settled down. The grandparents started dying. They had to close roads and turn back cars of women and children to prevent it from getting worse. That could happen here too; people don't think things through. They assume since their kids are not sick, it's OK. They forget about the asymptomatic carriers and that the elderly are more vulnerable.

[https://www.instructables.com/id/The-Pandemic-Ventilator/](https://www.instructables.com/id/The-Pandemic-Ventilator/)

is one option. I have heard about plans to use 3D printers to make some parts as well... I don't know much about what people are doing, I just know we need to be doing MORE.

Lives will depend on making more ventilators, and fast. A number of projects are ongoing. WHEN the hospital runs out of ventilators, what will you or your parents use?

Find out what others are doing in your area to help prepare, and if they are NOT involved then get them started NOW.

Not all of the people who need breathing assistance will need ventilators, some need extra oxygen, but I do not know the ratio. There will be a LOT of patients regardless. There are predictions ranging from 40-70% infection over the next year. Seattle has a population over 3 million as of 2019. ...A LOT of patients.

That is a serious shortage of ventilators.",0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0

To the red zone (in Lombardy the municipalities of Bertonico, Casalpusterlengo, Castelgerundo, Castiglione D'Adda, Codogno, Fombio, Maleo, San Fiorano, Somaglia, Terranova dei Passerini; in Veneto the municipality of Vò) and to the yellow zone (L'Emilia Romagna, Lombardy, Veneto, the provinces of Pesaro and Urbino, Savona), measures are added for the whole national territory. These are the decisions that will be taken by the Council of Ministers. 

**Decisions valid until 8 March.**

**The red zone**

The virus containment measures are: prohibition of removal by all individuals present; the ban on access, the suspension of events and initiatives, the closure of schools, the suspension of educational trips, the closure of museums and other cultural institutes, the suspension of the activity of public offices (except for essential services) , the suspension of insolvency procedures, the closure of all commercial activities with the exclusion of those of public utility, the suspension of transport services, the suspension of the activities of companies with the exclusion of those that provide essential services

**The yellow zone**

In these territories, sports events and competitions are suspended, as well as the travels of fans. However, the decree allows competitions to be held behind closed doors. All ""non-ordinary"" events, including cultural, recreational, sporting and religious events (cinemas, theaters, discos etc.) are also suspended. The opening of places of worship will be conditioned by the adoption of organizational measures to avoid gatherings of people. Schools of all grades will remain closed. The museums will be open on condition that they ensure a quota fruition method. Public competitions are suspended. Bars and restaurants will be able to carry out the services on the condition that they only serve customers with a seat and the customers will have to stay one meter away. There will be a limitation of visitor access to hospital facilities. Ordinary leave of health and technical personnel is suspended. In the provinces of Bergamo, Lodi, Piacenza and Cremona, large shopping centers are expected to close on the weekend. Gyms, sports centers and spas will remain closed in Lombardy and the province of Piacenza. The judicial offices will have a shorter schedule.

**On the whole national territory**

Prevention measures will be posted in all schools of order and grade. Disinfectant solutions for hand hygiene will be made available in public administration buildings and in premises open to the public. Mayors will promote the dissemination of information in business premises. Public transport companies will take extraordinary sanitization measures. In the competitive procedures, measures will be taken to reduce contacts between candidates. Anyone who has returned from China or the Italian red zone since February 14 must provide notice to their local health authority. Teleworking forms are facilitated. All educational trips are suspended until March 15th.

160,"\&gt;China isn’t even left wing by most standards. 

""most standards"" does not mean everyone's standards. If you're further left than Stalin then I'm sure everyone must seem like a right winger to you. Can you even define what right wing means? 

\&gt; What’s economically left wing about China? Do Chinese workers own the means of production? 

It's true China introduced some free market capitalism in the late 90's, and China stopped being a poor third world country soon after that happened. And it wasn't even unprecedented. Lenin basically did the same thing in the early days of the USSR, and it even seemed to work for a short while before Stalin rolled it all back. (but I'm just an ignorant right winger who knows nothing about ""true"" socialism, right?)

It's ironic that the part the left disowns about china is the part that most chinese would say has contributed the most to their current wellbeing, such as it is despite the communist legacy.

You're also using the underhanded Motte &amp; Bailey debate tactic here. We were talking about sociological topics like censorship of the press and authoritarianism (vis-a-vis the corona virus in communist China), and suddenly you attempt to shift the argument to economics. 

You guys do the same thing whenever people try to talk about the left wing roots of the nazis. If someone points out all the similarities between national socialism and other forms of socialism, they immediately hit back with the same ""workers own the means of production"" whataboutism, as though that one 19th century fart of an economic idea represents the entirety of the left wing ideology. 

China is still a one party authoritarian state that traces its lineage all the way back to Mao. If that's not left wing, then tell me what the fuck is. 

\&gt;You would be laughed out the room if you claimed that amongst genuine socialists and communists. 

Yeah, and that snobbish mentality is exactly why you're doomed as an ideology to stagnate. You haven't really progressed philosophically since the days of Marx, you've just become more underhanded and sneaky to force your ideas on people. Because you believe these ideas are perfect, and that people who disagree are just stupid and/or evil. 

Denial, deflection, projection and intimidation are all the left seems to have anymore, instead of arguments. They wouldn't try to persuade me I'm wrong, no, they'd just laugh me out the room and no doubt continue believing their ideas are 100% correct. 

But what when you can't ignore your critics anymore? Looking at the momentum of recent elections, it's not looking good for you lefties at the moment. There's a backlash coming, wether you realise it or not, depending on whatever media bubble you might be living in.

The way things are going, it won't be long before the left in the west is just a bunch of sad bearded dudes in a room pining for the good ol' days of Stalin that none of them ever even experienced first hand. 

Meanwhile the rest of the world will all be laughing at you and your tired old ""workers own the means of production"" bullshit, because we all know full well most of you ""genuine socialists and communists"" haven't worked an honest day in your lives and don't know what the hell you're talking about, and you never have.

161,"A lot of people don't see the big big picture. The modern CCP is dragging the whole world down a very dark road.

&amp;#x200B;

After years of multi-laterism, with Western powers building institutions and organisations like the UN, the World Health Organisation and pushing for democracy  / global standards on human rights, China is now trying to unpick it all for their own advantage. 

&amp;#x200B;

China is actively subverting democracies around the world - especially Taiwan and Hong Kong, which are most likely preludes to how it will treat other countries in the future. The CCP are expansionist; they are trying to steal territory left right and centre (from 'disputed' regions with its neighbours, to the South China Sea, Tibet, Taiwan, the Arctic and even space). They are trying to expand their sphere of power and influence outwards, appeasing them by giving them Taiwan or the South China Sea will most likely have no better results than it did with a certain German leader.

&amp;#x200B;

For anyone who would say that comparing the CCP to the Nazis is crude and contrived, you need only look to the facts. The CCP achieved power through civil war, they refuse their own people political alternatives or decision-making power, they are expansionist and they are actively attacking freedom of information / human rights around the world, they are oppressing their own people (stifling religious, political and even intellectual freedom / expression), and they are trying to export their lowest common denominator, free for all policy abroad by flirting with every dictatorship they can, who they have no moral qualms about endorsing or empowering. 

&amp;#x200B;

That is the true face of the CCP, they are undermining efforts to hold any country anywhere to any standard, because they would rather pump money into unaccountable dictatorships, regardless of what wrongs or atrocities they might be committing, than lose face and embrace democracy. The CCP believe in unaccountable, top down power, as long as they can be at the head of the table they don't care if we all one day live in a world populated by cruel and arbitrary authoritarian regimes that operate as open-air prisons. They would prefer it if each of those regimes imported Chinese surveillance technology and acted as information silos, with limited access to outside information (that might hold the regimes to account) and no rights to criticise the government or explore political alternatives.

&amp;#x200B;

The Chinese government is actively subverting the UN charter of human rights by trying to create its own version, arguing that social stability (as defined and dictated by the government) is the most fundamental human right. In other words, as long as the government is, very broadly speaking, providing some form of stability, any other human right is secondary, and can be violated in pursuit of 'stability'. China is now trying to sell this version of human rights around the world to justify the kinds of practices you see at home, in Hong Kong etc. etc.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope the experience of the coronavirus is a wake up call for the Chinese people, because the good people of Wuhan have been Xinjianged - they have been put on lock down, dragged out of their homes and forced into shoddy temporary quarantine sites that don't have sufficient medical resources, and when they have tried to speak up they have been drowned out by the states propoganda and censorship. The government has actively killed as many people as it has saved due to its heavy-handed miscalculations and its inability to show efficacy without resorting to unnecessary force.

&amp;#x200B;

Again, please don't buy products from China where it can be avoided, the country has been enriched by positive foreign business relations and engagement in recent decades, and instead of responding in kind (opening up, becoming more democratic) the CCP have been betraying and trying to manipulate the rest of the world ever since. They have tried to punch a whole in the world economy by systematically stealing foreign technology, subsidising their own companies in a way that does not respect WTO rules and denying foreign companies fair access to their own markets. Economically empowering modern China is empowering the CCP, and they have shown themselves to be bad actors in almost every conceivable way. We should not be buying the future the CCP want to foist on us, we shouldn't be rewarding them economically (and politically) while they are actively subverting all democracy, human rights, trust in politics and freedom around the world. We should not be paying them to make our world a worse place for us and our kids.",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
162,"I believe it depends on the region you live in.

During New Year, I was in my wife's hometown, a small town in JiangSu, a province near Shanghai, well developed and have some of the most minor affect during this corona virus, it actually have 0 reported death.

Anyway, during my stay there(Jan23-Feb2), there is no temperature check for commuity, supper market, I went to a restaurant once, before everything close, no temperature too. But there was  0 case in the city at that time. I don't know the situation there now.

When I came back to the city where I lived in, Zhuhai. The city near Macao. A city that had one of the highest infection rate outside Hubei. Well, it is basically every where.  
From airport to airport bus, to community, and to super market. This is basically all the places you can go, back to Feb2.

Now a lot of place have reopened, such as office building,  restaurant, barber shop. Basically all of them need temperature check for entering. Some bus needs temperature too.

Two types do not have temperature now, which is dangerouse I think. bus inside city and 7-11 type of store, I am not saying 7-11, did not go there, but the covenience store near my community did not check temperature.

Personally I do not believe, this scale of temperature check help much, since it is so inaccurate.   
But it is like taking a stance, shows that everyone is taking it seriously:

Quarantine, Mask and Temperature check",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

164,"The worst part about this is I don't see a way out. America is clearly descending into what you're describing and climate change is an even bigger problem that's global. Without America on board there's almost no way to deal with that either. 



We're in an age of radical evil. I saw an old man at the store with a maga hat with his granddaughter who was a toddler. This man is sentencing her generation to senseless mass death.

This is our Secretary of Commerce celebrating the corona virus in the sense that it will help bring jobs back to America. I wonder how much of this depravity Trump is responsible for. This is one of those examples of nonsensical evil just somehow occurring. There's no reason for the guy to say something like that and yet he just because it's cruel and he can't help himself. It reminds me of the whole trump movement in a nutshell. Just so hateful and cruel. 



What gives me hope or better yet strength though is thinking about how we're not the victims in this. We're the nazis. We're the bad guys here. And our ancestors had much more dire struggles than we have to deal with.",1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0
